0,2023-07-28,0.9949,"2023-07-28Wall Street eyes higher open after inflation data|July 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open higher on Friday after data showing easing inflation pressures added to hopes that the Federal Reserve's policy tightening was ending, while chip stocks surged as Intel posted a surprise quarterly profit. U.S. annual inflation slowed considerably in June, likely pushing the Federal Reserve closer to ending its fastest interest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s. In the 12 months through June, the PCE price index advanced 3.0%. That was the smallest annual gain since March 2021 and followed a 3.8% rise in May. ""With inflation going in the right direction, this should give some breathing room for the stocks to refocus on earnings, which continue to outpace expectations,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. Market expectations of another 25 basis point rate hike in November were largely unchanged at 29.9% after the data. IRPR Chipmaker Intel's (INTC.O) results and forecast pointed to an improving PC market, sending its shares up 6.2% in premarket trading. Peers Nvidia (NVDA.O), Micron Technology (MU.O) and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O) gained over 1% each. Global stock markets eased following Japan's tweaks to its monetary policy. The Dow snapped its longest winning streak since 1987 in the previous session as U.S. Treasury yields pressured stocks lower after news that the Bank of Japan will allow long-term interest rates to rise. On Friday, the Bank of Japan made its yield curve control policy more flexible and loosened its defense of a long-term interest rate cap, in moves seen by investors as a prelude to an eventual shift away from massive monetary stimulus. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note slipped, but still hovered close to its 4% level hit in the previous session. All three major U.S. indexes are on track to end the week marginally higher, supported by Big Tech earnings, hopes that the Fed's monetary policy tightening was ending and the world's largest economy was heading for a soft landing. At 8:40 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 163 points, or 0.46%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 30.75 points, or 0.67%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 171.5 points, or 1.1%. Ford Motor (F.N) slid 1.7% after Chief Executive Jim Farley outlined a change in the automaker's product strategy, slowing the ramp-up of money-losing EVs, shifting investment to its commercial vehicle unit and citing plans to quadruple sales of gas electric hybrids over the next five years. First Solar (FSLR.O) jumped 11.5% after its second-quarter earnings beat estimates and the company announced plans to spend up to $1.1 billion on its fifth U.S. factory. Enphase Energy (ENPH.O) fell 14.6% after the solar inverter maker's third-quarter revenue forecast missed expectations, Juniper Networks(JNPR.N) tumbled 7.0% after the network operator forecast third-quarter revenue below market estimates.

1,2023-07-28,0.9801,"2023-07-28U.S. lawmakers urge Biden administration to tighten AI chip export rules|SAN FRANCISCO, July 28 (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers who head a committee focused on China on Friday urged the Biden administration to tighten export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips in the wake of industry lobbying to leave the rules unchanged. Representative Mike Gallagher, a Republican and chair of the House of Representatives select committee on China, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat and ranking member of the committee, in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo called to ""further strengthen"" a sweeping set of export control rules implemented last October that cut off China's access to top AI chips made by U.S. firms such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Intel (INTC.O). The letter urges U.S. officials to take an even stricter approach than one Reuters reported last month that they are considering. The October 2022 rules impose two performance caps on exporting AI chips to China - one on how fast the chips can talk to one another, and the second on the chips' processing speeds. After the rules took effect, Nvidia created special chips for China with lower interconnect speeds. Intel this month also said it has created an AI chip that can be sold in China. But Nvidia's chips still have high enough processing speeds to be useful in creating AI systems, and Reuters reported in May that the U.S. export controls have done little to slow the progress of China's AI sector. Last month, Reuters reported that U.S. officials were considering tightening the rules by focusing on processing speeds alone, which could affect Nvidia's chips. Nvidia at the time said that restricting sales of its AI chips to China ""would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for the U.S. industry."" The potential tightening of the rules set off a flurry of lobbying activity, with the chief executives of Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm traveling to Washington last week to meet with administration officials to discuss China policy. The same day as the visit, the Semiconductor Industry Association, a U.S.-based industry group, urged the Biden administration to allow the ""the industry to have continued access to the China market, the world’s largest commercial market for commodity semiconductors."" On Friday, Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi urged an even tighter approach than the one Reuters previously reported officials are considering. The lawmakers' letter recommended keeping a speed limit on how fast chips can talk to one another and said it ""should be lowered sufficiently to prevent clever engineering that bypasses the regulations."" The lawmakers also urged administration officials to ""closely consider"" how to cut off Chinese firms' access to advanced computing chips in the cloud, where major U.S. firms such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google offer the chips for rent as part of their cloud computing services. ""We urge you to even further strengthen the October 7, 2022, rules so that advanced U.S. technology and expertise related to advanced computing and semiconductors are not used against the United States,"" Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi wrote.

2,2023-07-28,0.9517,"2023-07-28U.S. chipmaker AMD to invest $400 million in India by 2028|GANDHINAGAR, India, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) said on Friday it will invest around $400 million in India over the next five years and will build its largest design center in the tech hub of Bengaluru. AMD's announcement was made by its Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster at an annual semiconductor conference that started Friday in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat. Other speakers at the flagship event include Foxconn (2317.TW) Chairman Young Liu and Micron (MU.O) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Despite being a late entrant, the Modi government has been courting investments into India's nascent chip sector to establish its credentials as a chipmaking hub. AMD said it will open its new design centre campus in Bengaluru by end of this year and create 3,000 new engineering roles within five years. ""Our India teams will continue to play a pivotal role in delivering the high-performance and adaptive solutions that support AMD customers worldwide,"" Papermaster said. The new 500,000-square-foot (55,555 square yards) campus will increase AMD's office footprint in India to 10 locations. It already has more than 6,500 employees in the country. From personal computers to data centers, AMD chips are used in a wide range of devices. The Santa Clara, California-based firm is also working on an artificial intelligence chip that will take on market leader Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O). Unlike its top rival Intel, AMD outsources production of chips it designs to third-party manufacturers like Taiwan's TSMC. TSMC and the South Korea's Samsung are among the elite few chipmakers globally to have mastered cutting-edge chipmaking, a technology many nations are now vying for to avoid supply chain shocks, such as faced during the pandemic. India in 2021 unveiled a $10 billion incentive programme for the chip sector, but the plan has floundered as no company has so far managed to get clearance for setting up a fabrication plant, the centerpiece to Modi's ambitions. Other investments in India include a multi-year $400 million plan by U.S. chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT.O) in June to set up an engineering center, and chipmaker Micron' $825 million investment in a semiconductor testing and packaging unit in Gujarat.

3,2023-07-28,0.9896,"2023-07-28Intel results boost chip stocks on optimism PC market slump is ending|July 28 (Reuters) - Intel shares surged 7% on Friday, a day after the chipmaker's unexpectedly strong quarterly report heralded a turnaround in fortunes after a long, margin-sapping struggle due to plummeting PC sales and a highly competitive data center market. The company's surprise second-quarter profit and its strong earnings and margin forecasts suggested the personal computer market slump was nearing an end, sparking the surge in its stock (INTC.O) and the wider chip sector (.SOX). Intel is poised to add about $10 billion to its market value, based on its current premarket price of $37. That is already 6% higher than Wall Street's median target of $35 after at least 17 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock. ""Intel's turnaround is finally happening,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester. He also expects ""far better quarters ahead for Intel and most other chipmakers."" Intel's results lifted Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) by 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively, while Qualcomm (QCOM.O) rose 1.5%. A titan of the American chip industry, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as Taiwan's TMSC and Nvidia both in terms of margins and market value as the PC market downturn and stiff competition in the data center market battered its business. While Intel's shares have rallied 30% this year after a tough 2022, that has paled in comparison to the more than three-fold rise in Nvidia, which became the first chipmaker with a trillion-dollar market value in May after its own ""historic"" forecast. However, that was largely due to the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market, which Intel has missed out on because of its small presence in graphics-processing units and other AI specialist chips that enable the technology behind ChatGPT. Indeed, Intel's AI and data centers business contracted 15% in the recent quarter, and CEO Pat Gelsinger said a glut in the server central processing units (CPU) market will persist until the second half of the year. He added that Intel now has enough customer orders to sell at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips through 2024. Nonetheless, analysts at Rosenblatt Securities ""don't see AI as an investable theme for Intel currently."" Intel has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31.10, compared with Nvidia's 43.26 and an industry median of 19.95. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9896"
4,2023-07-28,0.9081,"2023-07-28TSMC says it is ""rooted in Taiwan"" even as it expands abroad|HSINCHU, Taiwan, July 28 (Reuters) - TSMC (2330.TW) will remain ""rooted in Taiwan"", its chief executive said on Friday in a bid to allay concerns that the world's largest contract chipmaker could abandon its island home as it expands abroad. CEO C.C. Wei was speaking at the opening of a massive research and development facility that TSMC, Asia's most valuable listed company and a key Apple Inc and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) supplier, built in Taiwan's tech hub Hsinchu. ""We want to use this opportunity to tell all the people of Taiwan that TSMC is determined to remain rooted in Taiwan,"" Wei said. ""Recently, to respond to customer requests, we have been building a lot of production lines around the world,"" he said. ""But we've also heard deeply concerned voices asking if TSMC has already moved its core abroad."" While the company makes the bulk of its chips in Taiwan, it has committed $40 billion to building a chip factory in the U.S. state of Arizona. It is also building one in Japan and considering a second one there, and is in talks with officials in Germany about building a plant there. TSMC's overseas expansions have sparked concerns in Taiwan, where chip manufacturing is the backbone of the economy, about a ""goodbye to Taiwan"" trend amid heightened tension with China and as other countries dangle incentives to attract chipmakers. China has in recent years increased diplomatic and military pressure against Taiwan, raising concerns about the fate of the factories that dot its western coast and produce the majority of the world's most advanced chips. Beijing views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a claim the government in Taipei rejects. The new home for TSMC's R&D efforts - with floor space spanning the equivalent of 42 soccer fields - will by September house more than 7,000 staff, including the researchers developing its most advanced technology as well as scholars working on exploratory research, the company said. The company broke ground on the facility in 2020. In 2022, TSMC ploughed T$162.2 billion ($5.16 billion) into R&D, up 30.1% from the previous year.

5,2023-07-28,0.9957,"2023-07-28Chinese AI arrives by stealth, not with a bang|HONG KONG, July 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China faces a long slog to artificial intelligence supremacy. It wants to be a leader in the field by 2030 and this month unveiled new rules governing the technology that are less onerous than expected. But closed online ecosystems, Beijing’s controls on internet content and U.S. curbs on semiconductor exports to the world’s second largest economy will hamper progress. There were high expectations of what the People's Republic could achieve with the technology seen as having the power to solve some of the most pressing challenges on the planet. “In the age of AI, where data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi Arabia”, venture capitalist Lee Kai-fu declared in 2018. Reasons for confidence included troves of data spanning everything from digital payments to e-commerce as well as government support and a growing army of entrepreneurs. Fast forward to today and things look far less compelling. China's latest regulations on generative AI - where algorithms trained on vast datasets and users' inputs learn to perform complex tasks – will pave the way for its tech champions to launch products to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT. Under the new policy set to go into effect next month, providers of services to the public must submit security assessments. That implies that national security concerns will restrict the technology's evolution and will pile more pain onto an industry President Xi Jinping has targeted in a brutal two-year crackdown aimed at curbing the disorderly expansion of capital. The scope and requirements are stricter than in other regions like the United States, where voluntary codes of conduct and rules are only starting to be considered. The European Union, for example, is trying to push ahead with legislation primarily targeting ""high risk"" AI applications such as those that can be used to influence election outcomes and platforms that have over 45 million users. Yet compared to China’s earlier April draft which contained near-impossible demands such requiring AI-created content to be true and accurate, the latest version seems practical and signals Beijing is serious about supporting the nascent sector to some extent. Notably, the new rules only apply to consumer-facing services, suggesting business products might be given more latitude. That should benefit outfits like search-engine operator Baidu (9888.HK), , the first major Chinese company to come up with an answer to ChatGPT. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon the $50 billion group led by Robin Li will be among the first batch of applicants to win approval to commercialise its chatbot, currently in testing phase, and estimate AI products can boost annual revenue by 13% in 2025. Baidu’s New York stock is up by 30% this year, outperforming the 9% rise in the Nasdaq Golden Dragon index of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. Yet the country also faces a unique set of challenges. Washington may soon tighten export restrictions to China by targeting AI semiconductors, according to the Wall Street Journal. Cutting off access to chips sold by Nvidia (NVDA.O) or AMD (AMD.O) might set Baidu and peers back by years. Moreover, the country may have leapfrogged the West in mobile payments and such, but China’s internet is dominated by a handful of giants that have built up walled gardens, where platforms keep information and user data to themselves. That means different companies will have access to very different types of data. That's one reason Bernstein analysts peg Tencent (0700.HK) and ByteDance, whose social media and video apps have the largest reach in the country, as the most promising AI contenders. There are other hurdles companies must navigate. Strict censorship requirements are one. China’s internet firewall that prohibits its citizens from accessing unapproved content will limit the amount of information companies can use to train their AI models, potentially leaving firms in the country at a disadvantage to Western peers. Another headscratcher is how to make money. Microsoft (MSFT.O) recently said it will charge $30 a month for generative-AI features in its widely-used office software. It’s hard to see how Chinese software or cloud providers like Alibaba (9988.HK), can charge premium prices to mainland businesses which lag by far their global counterparts when it comes to IT spending. Cumulative losses at the Alibaba-backed Megvii, which is preparing to go public in Shanghai, topped $1.8 billion between 2018 to 2020; listed peers SenseTime (0020.HK) and CloudWalk Technology (688327.SS) remain deep in the red too. A slowing economy and brutal price war in the fiercely competitive cloud market will only make monetising AI products harder. Perhaps the biggest uncertainty is whether Xi will allow the private companies currently leading the charge in AI to thrive. It would be at odds with his government's efforts to strengthen control over certain industries over the past few years. While officials are now reassuring investors that the environment for entrepreneurial businesses will improve, licensing requirements and the latest AI rules suggest Beijing will keep a tight grip over the sector and views it as highly strategic. That might best explain why U.S.-listed Alibaba in May announced plans for a full-separation of its cloud and data business. China’s AI moment has arrived, only with far less promise than initially hoped. (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own. Refiles to add links.)

The Dow closed higher for 13 straight sessions through Wednesday, its longest series of positive closes since 1987, and was last down 0.5% on Thursday afternoon after gaining earlier in the session. While the S&P 500 (.SPX), which includes over 500 stocks, is many investment professionals' preferred stock market benchmark, the Dow's daily moves are widely quoted in news media, making it widely recognized by many Americans. Its recent rally comes as traders widely believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday was the last in its campaign to control inflation. Investors are also optimistic the U.S. economy will avoid a recession. The Dow's longest-ever winning streak was 14 sessions, set in 1897, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Even after its recent gains, the Dow has lagged Wall Street's other main indexes in 2023. It is up 7% year to date, compared to a 18% gain in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq's (.IXIC) 35% surge. ""The Dow has been the laggard of the big three, and now it seems to be playing catch up. I think that catch-up trade is bringing us to a healthier place,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. The Dow's 30 constituents do not include market heavyweights Tesla (TSLA.O), Meta Platforms (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) or Amazon (AMZN.O), major winners in a stock market rally this year fueled by optimism about artificial intelligence and an eventual end to the Fed's rate hikes. ""We are actually seeing the market broaden out, so it's not just about seven artificial intelligence anointed darlings,"" Hogan added. Dow components Salesforce (CRM.N), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have rallied between 40% and 70% this year, making them the Dow's top performers. But the Dow has also been held back by declines of 10% or more in Amgen (AMGN.O), Chevron (CVX.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA.O). Overall, nearly half of Dow constituents remain down in 2023, even after outperforming so far in July. While the Dow's recent winning streak is unusually long, its overall strength has not been exceptional. The index climbed 4.8% since July 7, compared to 3.1% increase in the Nasdaq and a 3.4% rise in the S&P 500. The Dow's last 13-day winning streak in January 1987 produced a gain of 11.1%.

7,2023-07-27,0.9922,"2023-07-27Intel turns unexpected profit, higher forecast as PC market slide slows|July 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) on Thursday posted a surprise quarterly profit as a PC market slump started to ease, and forecast third-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up about 6%. The market for personal computers has tumbled over the past year, with inventory piling up because consumers had already bought machines needed during the pandemic. But the glut has started to ease, with PC shipments falling only 11.5% in the June quarter compared to a 30% slump in each of the previous two quarters, Canalys data showed. The PC market improvement prompted Intel to forecast better margins for the third quarter. Its margins in recent quarters were nearly half its historical highs, but Intel said on Thursday it expects profit margins to improve in the second half of the year. ""Intel did outperform almost exclusively on the strength of desktop sales which rebounded from a near-record low last quarter,"" said Edward Snyder, analyst at Charter Equity Research. Intel's stock rally added nearly $9 billion to the company's market value, which in recent years has fallen far below that of rivals including Nvidia (NVDA.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Broadcom (AVGO.O). After over four consecutive quarters of deep declines across its biggest segment that includes personal computers, revenue dropped 12% to $6.8 billion, from $7.7 billion in the year-ago period. Intel's foundry business, which aims to make chips for other companies and is its smallest sales contributor, reported revenue of $232 million, up from $57 million a year ago. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger told Reuters that some of the foundry sales increase came from ""advanced packaging,"" a process in which Intel can combine pieces of chips made by another company to create a more powerful chip. ""There's a lot of interest in the industry for advanced packaging, because it is essential to deliver high-performance computing and AI,"" Gelsinger said. ""So we expect a lot more business coming our way in that area."" On Tuesday, the company said it would work with Swedish telecommunications gear maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) on a chip that Intel will fabricate with its most advanced manufacturing technology it has disclosed. Sales in Intel's data center and artificial intelligence business fell 15% to $4 billion from $4.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Those results beat Wall Street estimates, but reflect that cloud majors Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet expect to ramp up spending on data centers with most of the spending benefiting Nvidia (NVDA.O) that makes chips for AI. The focus on chips that are suited for AI computing in the cloud have hurt the market for server chips for Intel, as has a sluggish recovery in China. ""It is still very clear that Intel is absolutely losing share around server CPUs, and I think it is fair to say that they are fighting for relevance in AI,"" said Jenny Hardy, portfolio manager at GP Bullhound that owns AMD and Nvidia stock. An inventory glut in server central processing units (CPUs), will persist until the second half of the year, Gelsinger said on the conference call, and that data center chip sales will decline modestly in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. Gelsinger said right now Intel has enough customer orders to sell at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips through 2024. Intel forecast adjusted current-quarter earnings per share of 20 cents. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected 16 cents. It forecast adjusted revenue of about $12.9 billion to $13.9 billion, compared to estimates of $13.23 billion. The midpoint of $13.4 billion exceeded estimates but still implies a 12.6% drop over the year in Intel's business. Intel forecast adjusted gross margin of 43% for the third quarter, compared to estimates of 40.6%. Intel shares have risen about 30% so far this year, compared to a 50% rise on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (.SOX) in anticipation of an industry recovery.

The Nikkei newspaper reported the central bank will maintain its 0.5% cap for the 10-year government bond yield, but discuss allowing long-term interest rates to rise above that level by a certain degree. Reuters confirmed the central bank may make minor tweaks to extend the lifespan of its yield control policy. Michael Green, chief investment strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said reports of the Bank of Japan's plans were the biggest driver behind Wall Street's performance on Thursday. Higher rates in Japan pushed the U.S. 10-year yield over 4% and reduced the attractiveness of stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 237.4 points, or 0.67%, to 35,282.72, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 29.29 points, or 0.64%, to 4,537.46 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 77.18 points, or 0.55%, to 14,050.11. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points as expected. Traders now only see a 20% chance that the Fed could surprise with a quarter-point increase in September. FEDWATCH Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that Fed staff are no longer forecasting a U.S. recession, but did not rule out another rate hike, saying the Fed would follow future economic data. On Thursday, a Commerce Department report showed the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the latest quarter, with an advance gross domestic product reading of 2.4%, above the 1.8% forecast by economists polled by Reuters. Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco, said the strong economic data earlier in the day also made the market reassess its positioning after the Federal Reserve slightly upgraded its growth outlook on Wednesday. ""The markets are looking at the increased potential for another Fed rate hike that had largely been priced out. Now it's being priced back in,"" said Rupert, who expects a Fed rate hike in September. Meta (META.O) gained 4.40% after it reported a jump in second-quarter advertising revenue, topping Wall Street financial targets. Microsoft, which on Tuesday surpassed estimates for quarterly revenue and profit, closed down 2.09%, as it laid out an aggressive spending plan to meet demand for its new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered services. Outsized gains in megacap growth stocks have helped the Nasdaq (.IXIC) lead the charge on Wall Street so far this year, with the index rising about 34%. EBay (EBAY.O) forecast third-quarter profit below market expectations as the e-commerce platform spent more to bolster categories such as auto parts, refurbished goods and collectibles, sending its shares down 10.53%. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Micron (MU.O) rose 0.99% and 5.48% respectively after Lam Research (LRCX.O) forecast upbeat quarterly sales. Shares of Lam also advanced. Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) tumbled 8.94% after the airline posted a dip in second-quarter profit, while Royal Caribbean (RCL.N) surged after the cruise operator lifted its annual profit forecast.

The deal comes as cloud computing providers around the world are searching for alternatives to chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), the market leader in AI computing whose products are in short supply, thanks to the surging popularity of ChatGPT and other services. Cerebras is one of several startups looking to challenge Nvidia. Silicon Valley-based Cerebras said that G42 has agreed to purchase three of what it calls its Condor Galaxy systems, all of which it will build in the U.S. to speed up the roll out. The first one will come online this year, with two more coming in early 2024. Cerebras Chief Executive Officer Andrew Feldman described the deal as the start of a ""strategic partnership"" and said the two companies are in talks for up to six additional supercomputers by late 2024. Feldman plans to move to the UAE for three months to work with G42 on developing its computing service based on the systems, calling it ""a rare opportunity to change a massive market."" Abu Dhabi-based G42, a tech conglomerate with nine operating companies that include datacenter and cloud service businesses, says it plans to use the Cerebras systems to sell AI computing services to health care and energy companies.

10,2023-07-27,0.9753,"2023-07-27Samsung to extend production cuts after $7 billion chip loss in first half|SEOUL, July 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) on Thursday said the worst is over for the global memory chip market but announced plans to extend production cuts because a demand recovery is largely constrained to high-end chips used in artificial intelligence. The move underscores the unprecedented semiconductor downturn that led the South Korean firm to incur a record 8.9 trillion won ($7 billion) operating loss from its bread-and-butter chip business in the first six months of this year. The business is likely to remain in the red in the current quarter, although the loss is seen almost halving to 2.3 trillion won from the second quarter, according to 22 analysts polled by Refinitiv. A global economic slowdown and high interest rates have dampened demand for most consumer goods following a pandemic-driven boom. ""Production cuts across the industry are likely to continue in the second half, and demand is expected to gradually recover as clients continue to destock their (chip) inventory,"" Samsung, the world's biggest memory chip maker, said in a statement. Jaejune Kim, executive vice president of Samsung's memory business, said on an earnings call that it would extend production cuts and make additional output adjustments for certain products including NAND flash chips, which are used to store digital data. He did not disclose the extent of Samsung's output cuts but noted the company's memory chip stocks were rapidly decreasing after peaking in May. The comments eased concerns about chip oversupply and boosted Samsung shares by 2%, while smaller rival SK Hynix's (000660.KS) shares jumped by 9% to the highest level since March 2022. SK Hynix, which said on Wednesday that it would cut NAND output by a further 5% to 10%, is seen benefiting more from the concerted efforts due to its heavy exposure to those chips. ""SK Hynix's weakness is NAND... and it's reporting a nearly 2 trillion won loss per quarter. More supply cuts could stabilise NAND prices... which would be very good news for Hynix,"" said Lee Min-hee, an analyst at BNK Investment & Securities. Samsung's chip division swung to a 4.36 trillion won operating loss in the April-June quarter from a 9.98 trillion won profit a year earlier. Losses shrank slightly from the first quarter's 4.58 trillion won due to strong memory chip demand from AI, which led to higher-than-expected shipments of DRAM chips that hold information from applications while the system is in use. However, Samsung is playing catch-up to SK Hynix, which was better prepared for AI-driven chip demand and leads the market in high-end DRAM chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) and premium DDR5 products used to feed data into AI chips, analysts said. ""Although Samsung was first in these high-density chips, it didn't anticipate these markets will grow so fast, and was superceded by SK Hynix in speed and yield,"" Lee said. SK Hynix became Nvidia's NVDA.O sole supplier for HBM3 chips last year, while Samsung expects to release its own HBM3 chips later this year, analysts noted. Samsung said on Thursday it had orders for more than 1.5 billion gigabytes of HBM products this year - double last year - and was working to increase supply capabilities. But a broader chip demand recovery will need to wait until next year, according to analysts, with AI remaining a rare bright spot in the global tech sector thanks to roaring investment following the successful launch of chatbot ChatGPT late last year. For the June quarter, Samsung reported a 95% plunge in operating profit to 669 billion won, broadly in line with the company's estimate but the second-lowest quarterly profit in 14 years. Its mobile business reported a 16% rise in operating profit to 3.04 trillion won and expects sales growth in the second half, driven by premium products. A day earlier, Samsung, the world's largest smartphone vendor, unveiled its latest foldable smartphones, keeping prices at about the same level for a third year as it seeks to challenge Apple's (AAPL.O) dominance in the high-end market.

Restrictions should not be so broad ""that you deny American companies revenue and China can get the product elsewhere, or China can get the product from other countries,"" Raimondo said at a forum. Rules ""will deny some revenue to American companies, but we think it's worth it."" Last week, U.S. chip company executives met with top Biden administration officials, including Raimondo, to discuss China policy, as the most powerful semiconductor lobby group urged a halt to more curbs under consideration. Raimondo said the administration is meeting with companies ""to get to the right place so we don't damage American business but quite frankly protect American national security."" Last year, China accounted for $180 billion in semiconductor purchases, close to a third of the worldwide total of $574.1 billion and the largest single market, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Nvidia (NVDA.O), Qualcomm (INTC.O) and Intel (QCOM.O) have crucial sales riding on China. Qualcomm is the only company with a license from U.S. regulators to sell mobile phone chips to Huawei (HWT.UL). The Biden administration is considering updating a sweeping set of rules imposed in October to hobble China's chip industry and a new executive order restricting some outbound investment. ""This isn't about holding China back or denying them commodity technology,"" Raimondo said. China wants access to the United States most sophisticated technology ""to advance their military and we're not going to allow that,"" she said. The ""timetable is as fast as we can and make sure it is correct,"" she added.

13,2023-07-26,0.9926,"2023-07-26Exclusive: Amazon has drawn thousands to try its AI service competing with Microsoft, Google|July 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) cloud division has drawn thousands of customers to try out its service vying with Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) in a key area of artificial intelligence, an executive told Reuters. The company also announced new AI tools on Wednesday, including a program for building more conversational customer-service agents, technology access from the startup Cohere and a healthcare system for generating clinical notes after a patient visit. Organizations including Sony (6758.T), Ryanair (RYA.I) and Sun Life (SLF.TO) have tried out Amazon Bedrock, a service the company announced in April that lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, Vice President Swami Sivasubramanian said. Such generative technology can produce new text, images and other content on command. ""Our mission is to make every company an AI company,"" said Sivasubramanian, in an interview pegged to a summit the cloud provider hosted in New York. Amazon Bedrock is the company's answer to services announced by Google and Microsoft, cloud rivals that have developed or marketed AI garnering significant public attention. Microsoft has invested in OpenAI, the startup that created ChatGPT and the AI model known as GPT-4. Amazon's disclosure of thousands of Bedrock users, previously unreported, shows its efforts are attracting interest as well. The company wants to offer a broader range of AI models than peers to win business, including access to updated technology from startups Anthropic and Stability AI, announced Wednesday. Amazon's role as the largest cloud provider by revenue - already hosting myriad customers' data - distinguishes it, too, the company has said. Amazon Bedrock will become available generally to any customer very ""soon,"" Sivasubramanian said. He declined to state when, adding the company aims to address issues around cost allocation and enterprise controls first. Industry has continued to grapple with the costs of AI more generally. Microsoft on Tuesday reported its highest quarterly capital expenditures since at least its fiscal 2016 as it builds data centers to support AI and battles other cloud companies for key chips from Nvidia (NVDA.O). Asked whether Amazon has given businesses with big AI ambitions a deadline to secure chip access, Sivasubramanian said, ""We are working with them to ensure we understand their ramp-up schedule."" The company meanwhile widened access to technology it billed as more efficient for training AI, based on Nvidia chips. The cloud provider also previewed Agents for Amazon Bedrock, which lets businesses create chatbots that execute tasks and give more personalized answers drawing from their proprietary data. An airline could build a virtual agent that books a flight for a traveler, for instance, based on a customer's price, destination and seating requests. The business potential for such agents have recently gripped Silicon Valley. And as part of its AI push, the company made an appeal to the healthcare industry specifically. It announced a service called AWS HealthScribe to let software vendors build apps to transcribe and analyze conversations between a doctor and patient. A unit of 3M (MMM.N) plans to use this to speed up clinical documentation, the companies said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

But expect deeper investments before gains trickle to the bottom line, the companies said on Tuesday. Microsoft said costs rose sharply as it built new data centers to support AI and that capital expenditures will continue to rise as it buys chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to power those data centers. The Windows maker's shares were down more than 3% on Wednesday, while Alphabet gained nearly 7%. Microsoft is bearing AI costs in two ways, analysts said: to power its own products such as its forthcoming $30-a-month Copilot AI assistant, and to serve companies wanting to use its Azure cloud computing services to create AI products. Microsoft executives said the service will start generating the bulk of its revenue in the second half of its fiscal 2024 ending June 30. ""They're buying a bunch of H100s,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst of Creative Strategies, referring to Nvidia's flagship chips for AI. ""You're probably going to see a similar thing with Amazon (AMZN.O), if not this quarter then the next quarter, because both of them are the clouds that the vast majority of the market is using for training (AI systems) right now."" Alphabet, however, kept down costs, though not for long. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who will become president and chief investment officer, said delays in data center construction are why second-quarter capex was lower than expected. ""As far as AI is concerned, while Google may have spent upwards of $200 billion on AI investments over the past decade, much of that isn't necessarily appreciated by users and investors,"" said Scott Kessler, global sector lead for technology media and telecommunications at Third Bridge. One advantage Google has, analysts said, is that it has its own custom chip for handling AI work called the Tensor Processor Unit (TPU), which helps lower costs. Microsoft may be ""aggressively buying Nvidia chips, given Microsoft does not have its own silicon as an alternative,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. But Google conceded that it will buy chips from other companies as well as using its own, and Porat said that spending could put a drag on profit and growth. ""The message on inflection point was the same,"" from Microsoft and Google, said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, ""but the difference was Microsoft investors wanted to see more.""

15,2023-07-25,0.9857,"2023-07-25Microsoft charges ahead with spending to serve AI demand|July 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Tuesday laid out an aggressive spending plan to meet demand for its new artificial intelligence services after surpassing Wall Street estimates for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and profit. Costs rose sharply as Microsoft built new data centers to support AI, and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on a conference call with analysts the company's capital expenditures would continue rising each quarter throughout fiscal 2024. Shares fell about 4% in after-hours trade. Wall Street is looking at how generative AI services may benefit Microsoft, which secured an early lead with investments in OpenAI, owner of the popular ChatGPT service. Microsoft is weaving AI into its own products, such as the $30-a-month ""Copilot"" assistant for its Microsoft 365 service that can summarize a day's worth of emails into a quick update. It is also aiming to sell cloud computing services that other firms will use to build AI services. Microsoft's results show heavy spending on AI services ahead of commensurate revenue growth. While its Azure sales growth slightly exceeded market expectations, Microsoft's quarterly capital expenditures hit the highest single-quarter total since at least its fiscal 2016. The company is battling other cloud providers for a limited supply of chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), whose graphics processing units are essential for creating AI products and services. CFO Hood told analysts that despite Microsoft's increased spending in fiscal 2024, operating profit margins would grow slightly after adjusting for the effects of an accounting rule change. ""The real focus here is being able to be aggressive in meeting the demand curve,"" Hood said. It will take time to make money, Hood said, noting that Copilot is not ready for general release and any revenues from the product are likely to happen toward the second half of fiscal 2024. Microsoft forecast Azure revenue growth of 25%-26% in constant currency for the fiscal first quarter, compared with an estimate of 25.6% from Visible Alpha that does not adjust for foreign exchange rates. For the segment that includes Azure, Microsoft forecast a first-quarter revenue range with a midpoint of $23.45 billion. Analysts on average estimated $23.55 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The midpoint of its first-quarter forecast for the segment containing Office was $18.15 billion, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $18.08 billion. Microsoft's forecast for its Windows segment had a midpoint of $12.7 billion, below analysts' estimate of $13.14 billion. Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 rose to $56.2 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $55.5 billion according to Refinitiv. Net income was $2.69 per share, above the $2.55 average estimate. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses the Azure cloud computing platform, increased its revenue to $24 billion slightly topped expectations according to Refinitiv data. Azure revenue rose 26%, beating a 25.2% growth estimate from Visible Alpha. Microsoft does not break out a precise quarterly revenue figure for Azure, the part of its business best situated to capitalize on booming interest in AI. But Chief Executive Satya Nadella said on a conference call that Azure accounted for more than half of the $110 billion for ""Microsoft Cloud"" in fiscal 2023, putting Azure sales at $55 billion or more and revealing the size of the business for the first time. The company is still navigating a PC business slump with sales, including of its Windows operating system, falling to $13.9 billion. The segment with the LinkedIn social network and its Office productivity software increased sales to $18.3 billion. Both segments slightly topped the average analyst estimate, according to Refinitiv data. Capital expenditures jumped to $10.7 billion from $7.8 billion in the fiscal third quarter, after the company told investors spending would rise as it builds out data centers for AI work.

For advanced packaging, especially TSMC's chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS), capacity is ""very tight,"" Wei said after the company reported a 23% fall in second-quarter profit. ""We are increasing our capacity as quickly as possible. We expect this tightening will be released next year, probably towards the end of next year."" The world's largest contract chipmaker said TSMC's position as the leading manufacturer of AI chips - including for chip designers Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) - has not offset broader end market weakness as the global economy recovers more slowly than it had expected. The Tongluo Science Park administration has officially approved TSMC's application to lease land, the company said, adding the new plant in the northern county of Miaoli would create about 1500 jobs.

Demand for the software used to design chips has risen even amid a cyclical downturn for the industry as chipmakers and tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) rush to create their own semiconductors needed for AI processing. But Cadence's current-quarter forecast had a midpoint slightly below analyst estimates, sending shares down 4.4% at $230.60 in after-hours trading. ""Similar to last quarter, shares have performed well into the results and backlog is down modestly (down $100M). I think it's just a little sell the news action after market,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy told Reuters in an email. Cadence also sells hardware systems that run its chip design software, and Chief Executive Anirudh Devgan told Reuters in an interview the current-quarter forecast is lower than it might otherwise be because ""some hardware deliveries are at the border in September and October."" He said the company is ""being extra conservative"" by forecasting those orders for the fourth quarter. Cadence forecast full-year revenue between $4.05 billion and $4.09 billion, largely above analysts' average estimate of $4.06 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The company's earlier estimate was for $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share for 2023 between $5.05 and $5.11, beating expectations of $5.03 per share. Revenue was $976.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, above estimates of $974.9 million. But Cadence gave a revenue forecast range of $990 million to $1.01 billion for the current quarter, with the midpoint of $1.0 billion falling slightly below Refinitiv estimates of $1.01 billion. Like its rival Synopsys Inc (SNPS.O), Cadence is hoping to benefit from AI in at least two ways: first, by providing tools to design chips for AI; and second, by adding AI into its own software to help in the complex process of designing chips.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) set out on Friday Microsoft's arguments for the reconsideration, as the U.S. battles to win UK approval to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision. Having initially blocked the $69 billion deal in April over concerns about its impact on competition in the cloud gaming market, the CMA has since reopened the file, after it was left increasingly isolated amongst world regulators in its opposition. The CMA said it is likely to be able to reach a new provisional view on the restructured deal in the week beginning Aug. 7. Explaining why the deal should now be given the green light, Microsoft argued that the binding commitments accepted by the European Union shortly after Britain had blocked the deal changed matters, court documents published showed. The software company gave legally-binding commitments to European authorities that Activision games can be streamed for a decade after the merger, and has entered into agreements with NVIDIA, Boosteroid and Ubitus. As part of that a monitoring and enforcement regime will be established, which Microsoft said should ease some of the CMA's concerns. Microsoft also argued that the terms of the CMA’s proposed block reached further than necessary to tackle its cloud gaming concerns, for example in covering Activision Blizzard’s King unit, which makes mobile device games like Candy Crush Saga. The CMA said it understood that Microsoft considered the recent licensing deal it agreed with Sony constituted a further material change of circumstance or special reason. For its part, the CMA dismissed as ""irrelevant and immaterial"" to its decision to look again at the deal the failure by U.S. authorities to get it blocked in the courts there. Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal provisionally approved the adjournment on Monday subject to further submissions from the parties. It formally granted it on Friday.
