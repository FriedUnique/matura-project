0,2023-07-28,0.9801,"2023-07-28U.S. lawmakers urge Biden administration to tighten AI chip export rules|SAN FRANCISCO, July 28 (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers who head a committee focused on China on Friday urged the Biden administration to tighten export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips in the wake of industry lobbying to leave the rules unchanged. Representative Mike Gallagher, a Republican and chair of the House of Representatives select committee on China, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat and ranking member of the committee, in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo called to ""further strengthen"" a sweeping set of export control rules implemented last October that cut off China's access to top AI chips made by U.S. firms such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Intel (INTC.O). The letter urges U.S. officials to take an even stricter approach than one Reuters reported last month that they are considering. The October 2022 rules impose two performance caps on exporting AI chips to China - one on how fast the chips can talk to one another, and the second on the chips' processing speeds. After the rules took effect, Nvidia created special chips for China with lower interconnect speeds. Intel this month also said it has created an AI chip that can be sold in China. But Nvidia's chips still have high enough processing speeds to be useful in creating AI systems, and Reuters reported in May that the U.S. export controls have done little to slow the progress of China's AI sector. Last month, Reuters reported that U.S. officials were considering tightening the rules by focusing on processing speeds alone, which could affect Nvidia's chips. Nvidia at the time said that restricting sales of its AI chips to China ""would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for the U.S. industry."" The potential tightening of the rules set off a flurry of lobbying activity, with the chief executives of Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm traveling to Washington last week to meet with administration officials to discuss China policy. The same day as the visit, the Semiconductor Industry Association, a U.S.-based industry group, urged the Biden administration to allow the ""the industry to have continued access to the China market, the world’s largest commercial market for commodity semiconductors."" On Friday, Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi urged an even tighter approach than the one Reuters previously reported officials are considering. The lawmakers' letter recommended keeping a speed limit on how fast chips can talk to one another and said it ""should be lowered sufficiently to prevent clever engineering that bypasses the regulations."" The lawmakers also urged administration officials to ""closely consider"" how to cut off Chinese firms' access to advanced computing chips in the cloud, where major U.S. firms such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google offer the chips for rent as part of their cloud computing services. ""We urge you to even further strengthen the October 7, 2022, rules so that advanced U.S. technology and expertise related to advanced computing and semiconductors are not used against the United States,"" Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi wrote.

1,2023-07-28,0.9578,"2023-07-28Capgemini's slower sales hit shares, to invest 2 billion euros in AI|July 28 (Reuters) - French IT consulting group Capgemini (CAPP.PA) posted weaker quarterly growth due to a slowdown across its regions, marked by a softer-than-expected U.S. market as clients cut costs. Its shares were down 5% at 1050 GMT, the biggest decliner among French blue-chip stocks (.FCHI). ""The U.S. market is a little bit softer than what we expected. We see more clients in cost cutting in the U.S., and that basically has put a bit more pressure on the U.S. market,"" CEO Aiman Ezzat told analysts on a call. Its second-quarter sales grew 5.2% at constant exchange rates, down from 10.7% in the first quarter. Revenue in the U.S., Capgemini's second-biggest market, was up 3% versus 6.1% in the prior quarter. Clients were in a ""wait and see"" mode in some industries, especially in the U.S., Chief Operating Officer Olivier Sevillia said, adding they were not dropping deals but shifting the timing of orders. ""Maybe Q4 is a bit too early,"" Sevillia said about a possible tipping point. He expected demand to resume strongly once the tides turned. Capgemini's half-year revenue rose 7.9% at constant rates to 11.43 billion euros ($12.53 billion) aided by demand for digital transformation, including artificial intelligence (AI). ""I am convinced that generative AI will play a major role in this transition,"" Ezzat said in a statement. Generative AI, a powerful form of AI able to generate text, images, and other content, has become popular since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot last November, increasing concerns over issues such as copyright, cybersecurity, privacy and AI replacing human jobs. The company, which aims to help businesses to adopt AI technology through recent partnerships with Microsoft and Google Cloud, said it planned to invest 2 billion euros in AI over three years. This should double the workforce of its data and AI teams to 60,000 people, it said. The group's total headcount was 349,500 at end-June, down 1% from a year earlier.

2,2023-07-28,0.991,"2023-07-28Meta plans retention 'hooks' for Threads as more than half of users leave app|NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) executives are heavily focused on boosting retention on their new Twitter rival Threads, after the app lost more than half of its users in the weeks following its buzzy launch, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday. Retention of users on the text-based app was better than executives had expected, though it was ""not perfect,"" said Zuckerberg, speaking at an internal company town hall, the audio of which was heard by Reuters. ""Obviously, if you have more than 100 million people sign up, ideally it would be awesome if all of them or even half of them stuck around. We're not there yet,"" he said. Zuckerberg said he considered the drop-off ""normal"" and expected retention to grow as the company adds more features to the app, including a desktop version and search functionality. Meta is looking at adding more ""retention-driving hooks"" to entice users to return to the app, like ""making sure people who are on the Instagram app can see important Threads,"" said Chief Product Officer Chris Cox. A company spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting. The executives' comments came a day after Meta wowed investors with a rosy revenue growth forecast, a sign of a comeback for a company that faced deep skepticism over its hefty spending on the metaverse last year as ad sales plummeted. The disclosure sent Meta's shares surging 8% on Thursday. Zuckerberg told employees on the call that he believed the company's work on the augmented and virtual reality technology that would power the metaverse was ""not massively ahead of schedule, but on track."" Meta, he added, needed to get started investing in that work ahead of rivals such as Apple (AAPL.O), Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O), given their years of experience building operating systems for existing products. ""That way, we have all the tools ready for when this is ready for prime time,"" he said, predicting that mass adoption of metaverse technologies would take place in the 2030s. Zuckerberg and Cox also highlighted the company's release of an artificial intelligence model called Llama 2 this month, which it made freely available for commercial use to any developer whose services had fewer than 700 million users. The model has received more than 150,000 download requests in the week since its release, Cox said. Responding to a question on the proposed ""cage match"" against Elon Musk, Zuckerberg said he was ""not sure if it's going to come together.""

3,2023-07-28,0.9957,"2023-07-28Chinese AI arrives by stealth, not with a bang|HONG KONG, July 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China faces a long slog to artificial intelligence supremacy. It wants to be a leader in the field by 2030 and this month unveiled new rules governing the technology that are less onerous than expected. But closed online ecosystems, Beijing’s controls on internet content and U.S. curbs on semiconductor exports to the world’s second largest economy will hamper progress. There were high expectations of what the People's Republic could achieve with the technology seen as having the power to solve some of the most pressing challenges on the planet. “In the age of AI, where data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi Arabia”, venture capitalist Lee Kai-fu declared in 2018. Reasons for confidence included troves of data spanning everything from digital payments to e-commerce as well as government support and a growing army of entrepreneurs. Fast forward to today and things look far less compelling. China's latest regulations on generative AI - where algorithms trained on vast datasets and users' inputs learn to perform complex tasks – will pave the way for its tech champions to launch products to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT. Under the new policy set to go into effect next month, providers of services to the public must submit security assessments. That implies that national security concerns will restrict the technology's evolution and will pile more pain onto an industry President Xi Jinping has targeted in a brutal two-year crackdown aimed at curbing the disorderly expansion of capital. The scope and requirements are stricter than in other regions like the United States, where voluntary codes of conduct and rules are only starting to be considered. The European Union, for example, is trying to push ahead with legislation primarily targeting ""high risk"" AI applications such as those that can be used to influence election outcomes and platforms that have over 45 million users. Yet compared to China’s earlier April draft which contained near-impossible demands such requiring AI-created content to be true and accurate, the latest version seems practical and signals Beijing is serious about supporting the nascent sector to some extent. Notably, the new rules only apply to consumer-facing services, suggesting business products might be given more latitude. That should benefit outfits like search-engine operator Baidu (9888.HK), , the first major Chinese company to come up with an answer to ChatGPT. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon the $50 billion group led by Robin Li will be among the first batch of applicants to win approval to commercialise its chatbot, currently in testing phase, and estimate AI products can boost annual revenue by 13% in 2025. Baidu’s New York stock is up by 30% this year, outperforming the 9% rise in the Nasdaq Golden Dragon index of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. Yet the country also faces a unique set of challenges. Washington may soon tighten export restrictions to China by targeting AI semiconductors, according to the Wall Street Journal. Cutting off access to chips sold by Nvidia (NVDA.O) or AMD (AMD.O) might set Baidu and peers back by years. Moreover, the country may have leapfrogged the West in mobile payments and such, but China’s internet is dominated by a handful of giants that have built up walled gardens, where platforms keep information and user data to themselves. That means different companies will have access to very different types of data. That's one reason Bernstein analysts peg Tencent (0700.HK) and ByteDance, whose social media and video apps have the largest reach in the country, as the most promising AI contenders. There are other hurdles companies must navigate. Strict censorship requirements are one. China’s internet firewall that prohibits its citizens from accessing unapproved content will limit the amount of information companies can use to train their AI models, potentially leaving firms in the country at a disadvantage to Western peers. Another headscratcher is how to make money. Microsoft (MSFT.O) recently said it will charge $30 a month for generative-AI features in its widely-used office software. It’s hard to see how Chinese software or cloud providers like Alibaba (9988.HK), can charge premium prices to mainland businesses which lag by far their global counterparts when it comes to IT spending. Cumulative losses at the Alibaba-backed Megvii, which is preparing to go public in Shanghai, topped $1.8 billion between 2018 to 2020; listed peers SenseTime (0020.HK) and CloudWalk Technology (688327.SS) remain deep in the red too. A slowing economy and brutal price war in the fiercely competitive cloud market will only make monetising AI products harder. Perhaps the biggest uncertainty is whether Xi will allow the private companies currently leading the charge in AI to thrive. It would be at odds with his government's efforts to strengthen control over certain industries over the past few years. While officials are now reassuring investors that the environment for entrepreneurial businesses will improve, licensing requirements and the latest AI rules suggest Beijing will keep a tight grip over the sector and views it as highly strategic. That might best explain why U.S.-listed Alibaba in May announced plans for a full-separation of its cloud and data business. China’s AI moment has arrived, only with far less promise than initially hoped. (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own. Refiles to add links.)

4,2023-07-28,0.9963,"2023-07-28Dow Jones index set to end 13 day winning streak|July 27 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was on the verge of ending its longest winning streak in 36 years on Thursday, successive gains showing that Wall Street's tech-driven rally is broadening to include a wider chunk of the stock market. The Dow closed higher for 13 straight sessions through Wednesday, its longest series of positive closes since 1987, and was last down 0.5% on Thursday afternoon after gaining earlier in the session. While the S&P 500 (.SPX), which includes over 500 stocks, is many investment professionals' preferred stock market benchmark, the Dow's daily moves are widely quoted in news media, making it widely recognized by many Americans. Its recent rally comes as traders widely believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday was the last in its campaign to control inflation. Investors are also optimistic the U.S. economy will avoid a recession. The Dow's longest-ever winning streak was 14 sessions, set in 1897, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Even after its recent gains, the Dow has lagged Wall Street's other main indexes in 2023. It is up 7% year to date, compared to a 18% gain in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq's (.IXIC) 35% surge. ""The Dow has been the laggard of the big three, and now it seems to be playing catch up. I think that catch-up trade is bringing us to a healthier place,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. The Dow's 30 constituents do not include market heavyweights Tesla (TSLA.O), Meta Platforms (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) or Amazon (AMZN.O), major winners in a stock market rally this year fueled by optimism about artificial intelligence and an eventual end to the Fed's rate hikes. ""We are actually seeing the market broaden out, so it's not just about seven artificial intelligence anointed darlings,"" Hogan added. Dow components Salesforce (CRM.N), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have rallied between 40% and 70% this year, making them the Dow's top performers. But the Dow has also been held back by declines of 10% or more in Amgen (AMGN.O), Chevron (CVX.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA.O). Overall, nearly half of Dow constituents remain down in 2023, even after outperforming so far in July. While the Dow's recent winning streak is unusually long, its overall strength has not been exceptional. The index climbed 4.8% since July 7, compared to 3.1% increase in the Nasdaq and a 3.4% rise in the S&P 500. The Dow's last 13-day winning streak in January 1987 produced a gain of 11.1%.

5,2023-07-27,0.9922,"2023-07-27Intel turns unexpected profit, higher forecast as PC market slide slows|July 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) on Thursday posted a surprise quarterly profit as a PC market slump started to ease, and forecast third-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up about 6%. The market for personal computers has tumbled over the past year, with inventory piling up because consumers had already bought machines needed during the pandemic. But the glut has started to ease, with PC shipments falling only 11.5% in the June quarter compared to a 30% slump in each of the previous two quarters, Canalys data showed. The PC market improvement prompted Intel to forecast better margins for the third quarter. Its margins in recent quarters were nearly half its historical highs, but Intel said on Thursday it expects profit margins to improve in the second half of the year. ""Intel did outperform almost exclusively on the strength of desktop sales which rebounded from a near-record low last quarter,"" said Edward Snyder, analyst at Charter Equity Research. Intel's stock rally added nearly $9 billion to the company's market value, which in recent years has fallen far below that of rivals including Nvidia (NVDA.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Broadcom (AVGO.O). After over four consecutive quarters of deep declines across its biggest segment that includes personal computers, revenue dropped 12% to $6.8 billion, from $7.7 billion in the year-ago period. Intel's foundry business, which aims to make chips for other companies and is its smallest sales contributor, reported revenue of $232 million, up from $57 million a year ago. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger told Reuters that some of the foundry sales increase came from ""advanced packaging,"" a process in which Intel can combine pieces of chips made by another company to create a more powerful chip. ""There's a lot of interest in the industry for advanced packaging, because it is essential to deliver high-performance computing and AI,"" Gelsinger said. ""So we expect a lot more business coming our way in that area."" On Tuesday, the company said it would work with Swedish telecommunications gear maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) on a chip that Intel will fabricate with its most advanced manufacturing technology it has disclosed. Sales in Intel's data center and artificial intelligence business fell 15% to $4 billion from $4.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Those results beat Wall Street estimates, but reflect that cloud majors Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet expect to ramp up spending on data centers with most of the spending benefiting Nvidia (NVDA.O) that makes chips for AI. The focus on chips that are suited for AI computing in the cloud have hurt the market for server chips for Intel, as has a sluggish recovery in China. ""It is still very clear that Intel is absolutely losing share around server CPUs, and I think it is fair to say that they are fighting for relevance in AI,"" said Jenny Hardy, portfolio manager at GP Bullhound that owns AMD and Nvidia stock. An inventory glut in server central processing units (CPUs), will persist until the second half of the year, Gelsinger said on the conference call, and that data center chip sales will decline modestly in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. Gelsinger said right now Intel has enough customer orders to sell at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips through 2024. Intel forecast adjusted current-quarter earnings per share of 20 cents. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected 16 cents. It forecast adjusted revenue of about $12.9 billion to $13.9 billion, compared to estimates of $13.23 billion. The midpoint of $13.4 billion exceeded estimates but still implies a 12.6% drop over the year in Intel's business. Intel forecast adjusted gross margin of 43% for the third quarter, compared to estimates of 40.6%. Intel shares have risen about 30% so far this year, compared to a 50% rise on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (.SOX) in anticipation of an industry recovery.

6,2023-07-27,0.9955,"2023-07-27Wall Street closes down, Dow snaps longest winning streak since 1987|July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Thursday after news that the Bank of Japan will allow long-term interest rates to rise sent U.S. yields higher, snapping the longest winning streak for the Dow since 1987. The Nikkei newspaper reported the central bank will maintain its 0.5% cap for the 10-year government bond yield, but discuss allowing long-term interest rates to rise above that level by a certain degree. Reuters confirmed the central bank may make minor tweaks to extend the lifespan of its yield control policy. Michael Green, chief investment strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said reports of the Bank of Japan's plans were the biggest driver behind Wall Street's performance on Thursday. Higher rates in Japan pushed the U.S. 10-year yield over 4% and reduced the attractiveness of stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 237.4 points, or 0.67%, to 35,282.72, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 29.29 points, or 0.64%, to 4,537.46 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 77.18 points, or 0.55%, to 14,050.11. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points as expected. Traders now only see a 20% chance that the Fed could surprise with a quarter-point increase in September. FEDWATCH Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that Fed staff are no longer forecasting a U.S. recession, but did not rule out another rate hike, saying the Fed would follow future economic data. On Thursday, a Commerce Department report showed the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the latest quarter, with an advance gross domestic product reading of 2.4%, above the 1.8% forecast by economists polled by Reuters. Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco, said the strong economic data earlier in the day also made the market reassess its positioning after the Federal Reserve slightly upgraded its growth outlook on Wednesday. ""The markets are looking at the increased potential for another Fed rate hike that had largely been priced out. Now it's being priced back in,"" said Rupert, who expects a Fed rate hike in September. Meta (META.O) gained 4.40% after it reported a jump in second-quarter advertising revenue, topping Wall Street financial targets. Microsoft, which on Tuesday surpassed estimates for quarterly revenue and profit, closed down 2.09%, as it laid out an aggressive spending plan to meet demand for its new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered services. Outsized gains in megacap growth stocks have helped the Nasdaq (.IXIC) lead the charge on Wall Street so far this year, with the index rising about 34%. EBay (EBAY.O) forecast third-quarter profit below market expectations as the e-commerce platform spent more to bolster categories such as auto parts, refurbished goods and collectibles, sending its shares down 10.53%. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Micron (MU.O) rose 0.99% and 5.48% respectively after Lam Research (LRCX.O) forecast upbeat quarterly sales. Shares of Lam also advanced. Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) tumbled 8.94% after the airline posted a dip in second-quarter profit, while Royal Caribbean (RCL.N) surged after the cruise operator lifted its annual profit forecast.

7,2023-07-27,0.9451,"2023-07-27Microsoft in EU antitrust crosshairs over Teams, Office tie-up|BRUSSELS, July 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Thursday found itself the target of an European Union antitrust investigation over the bundling of its chat and video app Teams with its Office product, putting it at risk of a hefty fine. The U.S. tech giant has racked up 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in EU antitrust fines in the previous decade for practices in breach of EU competition rules, including tying or bundling two or more products together. Since then Microsoft has adopted a more conciliatory approach with the European Commission. The European Commission's investigation followed a complaint by Salesforce-owned (CRM.N) workspace messaging app Slack in 2020 and after the U.S. tech giant's offer of remedies failed to address the EU competition enforcer's concerns. Teams, which Microsoft added to Office 365 in 2017 for free to eventually replace Skype for Business, soared in popularity during the pandemic especially after it offered video conferencing. The Commission is seeking to fast track the case and is looking to issue formal charges against Microsoft in the autumn unless the company improves its concessions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The EU competition enforcer said it was concerned that Microsoft may be abusing and defending its market position in productivity software by restricting competition in the European communication and collaboration products market. ""Remote communication and collaboration tools like Teams have become indispensable for many businesses in Europe. We must therefore ensure that the markets for these products remain competitive, and companies are free to choose the products that best meet their needs,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. A spokesperson for Microsoft said Microsoft would continue to co-operate with the European Commission and that the company remained committed to finding solutions to address the Commission's concerns. Reuters reported earlier this month that the EU antitrust watchdog was set to open a probe after Microsoft declined to offer bigger price cuts on its Office without Teams. The European Commission hopes a price differential between Office with Teams and Office without the app will ensure a level playing field with rivals and give consumers more choice, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. German rival alfaview, which last week filed a complaint similar to Slack's with the EU executive, welcomed the EU investigation. ""With our complaint, we want to make clear that this is not about a fight between two US tech giants, but about the protection of innovations of all kinds,"" its CEO and founder Niko Fostiropoulos said in a statement.

In a letter released Thursday, Wyden said ""even with the limited details that have been made public so far, Microsoft bears significant responsibility for this new incident."" The FTC, the Justice Department, and the Cybersecurity Agency - known as CISA - did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. In a statement, Microsoft did not respond directly to Wyden's allegation but said would ""work directly with government agencies on this issue, and maintain our commitment to continue sharing information."" Microsoft has been under increasing scrutiny following revelations that hackers allegedly operating on Beijing's behalf got hold of one of its cryptographic keys and took advantage of a coding flaw to win sweeping access to the company's cloud email platform. That access was used to spy on the communications of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and senior State Department diplomats. On Friday The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing-linked hackers accessed the email account of the U.S. ambassador to China in an espionage operation thought to have compromised at hundreds of thousands of U.S. government emails. In his letter, Wyden called on CISA to get the Cyber Safety Review Board - an air accident investigation-style body - to open an inquiry into the hack. He also called on the Department of Justice to see ""whether Microsoft's negligent practices violated federal law"" and on the FTC to investigate whether the incident overlapped with 20-year-long consent degree that expired in late 2022.

9,2023-07-27,0.9956,"2023-07-27Facebook parent Meta sees advertising jump, tops Wall Street targets|July 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) on Wednesday reported a strong rise in advertising revenue, topping Wall Street financial targets for the second quarter and forecasting third-quarter revenue above market expectations. The results from Meta, Facebook's parent company, come a day after a strong performance from Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and make the case that consumers, and the advertisers eager to reach them, are spending despite broad economic concerns. Still, the company also forecast that expenses would rise in both 2023 and 2024, citing costs including legal fees and increased spending on infrastructure considered key to the tech sector's feverish AI race. That spending comes after aggressive cost-cutting in other parts of the company, including safety teams and basic business functions. Meta shares were up 7.5% in after-hours trade. ""We continue to see strong engagement across our apps and we have the most exciting roadmap I've seen in a while with Llama 2, Threads, Reels, new AI products in the pipeline, and the launch of Quest 3 this fall,"" Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said. Meta's second-quarter revenue grew 11% to $32 billion in the quarter ended June 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of $31.12 billion. Ad revenue rose 12% in the quarter, faster than growth at Google, where ad revenue rose 3%. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.98 topped Wall Street targets of $2.91, according to data from Refinitiv. The social media giant has been climbing back from a bruising 2022, buoyed by hype around emerging AI technology and an austerity drive in which it has shed around 21,000 employees since last fall. The company's shares have more than doubled in value this year as a result. Advertisers are reinforcing those gains by pumping money into digital ads again after months of muted spending, heartened by signs that the economy may overcome a bout of high inflation without suffering a major meltdown. Brands are hedging their bets, however, and sticking with tried and true platforms. That helps Meta and Alphabet while punishing smaller players like Snap (SNAP.N), which reported disappointing sales on Tuesday. Meta's revenue forecast did not specify whether the figure includes any sales that might come from the recently launched Threads app, which does not yet have ads. The revenue gains provide relief as Meta makes massive investments to upgrade its data centers and stay competitive in an emerging arms race around AI technology, while continuing to invest more than $10 billion a year in a longer-term bet on ""metaverse"" hardware and software. Meta cut its capital expenditure forecast for 2023, driven in part by pushing some costs related to artificial intelligence into 2024, when capex is expected to grow. Zuckerberg told investors that executives were ""debating heavily"" how much AI capacity to bring online to prepare for a potential explosion in need. He saw three product categories for AI: features for advertisers, AI agents on chat and internal company productivity tools. He said he envisioned some revenue coming from Meta's recently released Llama 2 model, which is largely open source but requires a license for use by companies with more than 700 million users. ""We want this to be open. But if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to basically be reselling these services, that's something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for,"" Zuckerberg said. Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is responsible for developing metaverse-oriented technology like augmented reality glasses, reported sales of $276 million, down from $452 million in the same quarter last year. The unit lost $3.7 billion in the second quarter, putting it on track to have far higher costs than the $5 billion annual target set out in a widely circulated investor note in the fall. The unit has lost more than $40 billion since 2021, including $13.7 billion last year. Meta said it expected Reality Labs operating losses to ""increase meaningfully"" in 2024 as the company continued to invest in augmented and virtual reality and ""scale our ecosystem.""

The company expects 2023 total expenses in the range of $88 billion to $91 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $86 billion to $90 billion, citing ""legal-related expenses."" Meta said second-quarter expenses included legal costs of $1.87 billion, mostly related to a fine by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner in May for transferring user information to the United States. The fine itself was 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion). It said it expected ""higher infrastructure-related costs"" in 2024, as well as growth in payroll expenses ""as we evolve our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.""

The streaming company launched the $7-per-month plan with commercials last year in 12 markets, including the U.S., to attract more customers and selected Microsoft as its technology and sales partner for the offering, partly because it offered to pay a revenue guarantee, the report said. Netflix is now reworking the agreement to reduce the revenue guarantee due to slowing growth of the ad tier, the report said, adding that company executives are frustrated that Microsoft has not sold more ad inventory. In addition, Netflix has held early discussions to sell ads through other partners apart from Microsoft, and has also offered them better deals, the report said. Some advertisers have agreed to pay Netflix roughly $39 to $45 per 1,000 viewers in recent deals, according to ad buyers, down from around $45 to $55, WSJ said. Microsoft declined to comment, while Netflix did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Last week, the video-streaming company reported a lackluster revenue rise which sparked concerns of a longer road to growth from its new initiatives, with co-CEO Greg Peters cautioning it would take ""several quarters"" to see returns from those efforts.

Ferrovial has been providing artificial intelligence services to its businesses and employees since April after two years of work on an AI solutions centre in Spain. ""We have been very fast ... Highways and airports are using artificial intelligence solutions, but the volume of technology we are going to deploy by 2024 will be much higher,"" Luis Carlos Pietro Fernandez said at the Ferrovial headquarters in Madrid. The builder of highways, airports, metro lines and the largest shareholder in Heathrow Airport has recently moved its holding company to the Netherlands as part of efforts to become listed in the United States, one of its key markets. Ferrovial is working with Microsoft AI products, but has its own, completely isolated version, and is building the framework for an AI service that will help its various businesses. Some 24,000 Ferrovial employees already have access to the proprietary service, which they can use anonymously, to help them write emails or do translations, among other things. The hub has created a tool for Heathrow, Britain's largest airport, to predict how passenger traffic would change if a conflict or natural disaster occurred elsewhere and affected the normal flow of passengers, Fernandez said. It can also identify anomalies, such as cracks in airport runways, making inspection work easier. Ferrovial, which is also responsible for the expansion and future operation of New York's JFK airport, is developing tools to help identify bottlenecks at airports and quickly alert airlines in the short term. Among other things, they would be able by next year to detect when airport counters are starting to fill up and more need to be opened. The company is also using AI tools on its highways to detect cars going the wrong way, objects or people on the road, and is working on perfecting the sensors. In parallel, Ferrovial is working on ways to communicate directly with motorists using its U.S. toll roads and give them more information than just the rates. AI will also help it contact potential users to offer discounts and attract more traffic. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by a widely expected 25 basis points, marking the 11th hike in the U.S. central bank's past 12 policy meetings. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference the central bank will make decisions meeting by meeting, closely watching economic data, but noted that a rate cut is very unlikely this year. Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients that the Fed's statement did not signal a slower pace of hikes in the future, but that the bank was expecting a hold in September. ""The message for the market was that it didn't move the needle. There's always a fear of a big surprise,"" said Angelo Kourfafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones. Powell's message was clearly that the Fed will wait and see economic data to make new decisions, said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. ""I think the Fed won't stop until they see wage inflation down."" Following long-awaited earnings on Tuesday, big tech companies' shares had mixed reactions. Microsoft (MSFT.O) eased 3.72% after laying out an aggressive spending plan to meet demand for its new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered services.

14,2023-07-26,0.9795,"2023-07-26Morning Bid: China realism returns, Powell has spoken|July 27 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. A sense of cautious optimism could be the tone across Asia early on Thursday as China's markets cool down, investors welcome fairly balanced comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and await the European Central Bank's rate decision. After a volatile start to markets this week, the concentration of major 'event risk' - the Fed and ECB meetings, the Bank of Japan's policy decision on Friday and potential details on China's stimulus measures - may be keeping investors from taking big bets. That said, some big earnings reports from some of the biggest U.S. tech firms continue to roll in, meaning there could be big price swings in individual stocks and sectors under the hood of the broader indices. This was in evidence on Wednesday on Wall Street. The Nasdaq fell only 0.1% and 'big tech' fell less than 1% but that masked huge moves in some shares which added or wiped out tens of billions of dollars of market cap. Microsoft fell 4%, Snap plunged 15%, while Alphabet surged 5.5%. Shares in Meta jumped 7% in after hours trade after the Facebook owner reported stronger-than-expected Q2 revenues and forecast strong Q3 revenues. Investors in Asia will also wake up to the 11th U.S. interest rate hike since the Fed began hiking rates last year - and the highest rates in 22 years - and a fairly balanced policy outlook for the coming months from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He left the door open to further tightening but also said the Fed could stay on hold if the data warranted and stressed that decisions will be made on a meeting by meeting basis. His measured remarks helped ensure a fairly subdued day on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrials rose 0.24%, insignificant in itself but at the same time historic - it was the 13th consecutive daily rise, the index's longest winning streak since January 1987. Few would have imagined then that the market's biggest ever fall - the 22% crash on Black Monday - was only nine months away. Back in Asia, a sense of realism returned over the expected measures from Beijing to revitalize the economy. After outsized gains on Tuesday - a 14% surge in property stocks - major indices in China and Hong Kong closed in the red. The main event on Thursday's economic calendar is Chinese industrial profits for June, which could underline how weak the economy has been since Covid restrictions were lifted. Profits have been falling every month for a year, registering double-digit declines every month so far this year. They slumped 18.8% in May.

15,2023-07-26,0.9926,"2023-07-26Exclusive: Amazon has drawn thousands to try its AI service competing with Microsoft, Google|July 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) cloud division has drawn thousands of customers to try out its service vying with Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) in a key area of artificial intelligence, an executive told Reuters. The company also announced new AI tools on Wednesday, including a program for building more conversational customer-service agents, technology access from the startup Cohere and a healthcare system for generating clinical notes after a patient visit. Organizations including Sony (6758.T), Ryanair (RYA.I) and Sun Life (SLF.TO) have tried out Amazon Bedrock, a service the company announced in April that lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, Vice President Swami Sivasubramanian said. Such generative technology can produce new text, images and other content on command. ""Our mission is to make every company an AI company,"" said Sivasubramanian, in an interview pegged to a summit the cloud provider hosted in New York. Amazon Bedrock is the company's answer to services announced by Google and Microsoft, cloud rivals that have developed or marketed AI garnering significant public attention. Microsoft has invested in OpenAI, the startup that created ChatGPT and the AI model known as GPT-4. Amazon's disclosure of thousands of Bedrock users, previously unreported, shows its efforts are attracting interest as well. The company wants to offer a broader range of AI models than peers to win business, including access to updated technology from startups Anthropic and Stability AI, announced Wednesday. Amazon's role as the largest cloud provider by revenue - already hosting myriad customers' data - distinguishes it, too, the company has said. Amazon Bedrock will become available generally to any customer very ""soon,"" Sivasubramanian said. He declined to state when, adding the company aims to address issues around cost allocation and enterprise controls first. Industry has continued to grapple with the costs of AI more generally. Microsoft on Tuesday reported its highest quarterly capital expenditures since at least its fiscal 2016 as it builds data centers to support AI and battles other cloud companies for key chips from Nvidia (NVDA.O). Asked whether Amazon has given businesses with big AI ambitions a deadline to secure chip access, Sivasubramanian said, ""We are working with them to ensure we understand their ramp-up schedule."" The company meanwhile widened access to technology it billed as more efficient for training AI, based on Nvidia chips. The cloud provider also previewed Agents for Amazon Bedrock, which lets businesses create chatbots that execute tasks and give more personalized answers drawing from their proprietary data. An airline could build a virtual agent that books a flight for a traveler, for instance, based on a customer's price, destination and seating requests. The business potential for such agents have recently gripped Silicon Valley. And as part of its AI push, the company made an appeal to the healthcare industry specifically. It announced a service called AWS HealthScribe to let software vendors build apps to transcribe and analyze conversations between a doctor and patient. A unit of 3M (MMM.N) plans to use this to speed up clinical documentation, the companies said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The group will focus on coordinating safety research and articulating best practices of what is called ""frontier AI models"" that exceed the capabilities present in the most advanced existing models. They are highly capable foundation models that could have dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety, industry leaders have warned. Generative AI models, like the one behind chatbots like ChatGPT, extrapolate large amounts of data at high speed to share responses in the form of prose, poetry and images. While the use cases for such models are plenty, government bodies including the European Union and industry leaders including OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman have said appropriate guardrail measures would be necessary to tackle the risks posed by AI. ""Companies creating AI technology have a responsibility to ensure that it is safe, secure and remains under human control,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement. The industry body, Frontier Model Forum, will also work with policymakers and academics, facilitating information sharing among companies and governments. It will not engage in lobbying, an OpenAI spokesperson said, but will focus early on developing and sharing a public library of benchmarks and technical evaluations for frontier AI models. The forum will create an advisory board in the coming months and also arrange for funding with a working group as well as create an executive board to lead its efforts.

""There's still a lot of excitement around AI, but nobody quite understands what that means for the bottom line of many of these companies."" The NYSE FANG+ index (.NYFANG), which houses many megacap growth names, was down 0.2%. The index has risen about 76% so far this year, driven by the frenzy around AI. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) was an outlier. Its shares rose 5.6% after the company beat expectations for second-quarter results. Alphabet looks set to add about $100 billion to its market capitalization. The recent rally has driven up Microsoft's valuation. The stock is trading at 31 times 12-month forward earnings, compared to a PE multiple of 20 for Alphabet. ""The tech earnings season has started on a mixed note,"" said Mark Haefele, global wealth management chief investment officer at UBS in a client note.

FED FEARS vs. AI BOOST Investors also remained cautious on Wednesday, with Wall Street's main indexes muted ahead of a likely Federal Reserve interest rate hike later in the day that could push borrowing costs to their highest since the global financial crisis. Large tech companies, which rely heavily on borrowed money, have been pressured since the Fed started its tightening cycle to tame inflation. However, optimism over AI and hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle have supported tech stocks in recent months. Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital, said tech stocks tend to be fairly exposed to such sentiment around central bank policy as many of them are reliant on robust economic growth to deliver the returns they promise. ""There are valid concerns that the U.S. economy is weakening, but until the Fed sees sustained evidence of softening inflationary pressures, the hawkish stance will be maintained, even at the risk of tipping the economy into negative growth.""

Meta released Llama2, a commercial version of Llama, this month to provide businesses a powerful free-of-charge alternative to pricey proprietary models sold by OpenAI and Google. At the time, Meta said its preferred partner for Llama2 was Microsoft (MSFT.O) but it would also be available through other partners. “Today, Alibaba Cloud has launched the first training and deployment solution for the entire Llama2 series in China, welcoming all developers to create customised large models on Alibaba Cloud,” Alibaba Cloud said in a statement on Tuesday published on its WeChat account. The relationship with Meta could provide sticky customers for Alibaba's cloud business at a time it is facing intensified competition at home and is planning a stock market listing. The U.S. has been actively looking to restrict Chinese companies' access to many U.S.-developed technologies related to AI, particularly in the area of AI semiconductors. The Llama2 move would allow Alibaba to further its own AI ambitions by keeping abreast of the latest developments in the technology. For Meta, whose Facebook social media platform has for years been banned in China along with other Western platforms, it could bring closer ties with the world's second-biggest economy. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment. Alibaba Cloud did not respond to a request for comment. China has been trying to catch up to the U.S. in the field of AI as Beijing encourages Chinese companies to quickly develop homegrown and ""controllable"" AI models that can rival those developed by U.S. companies. Alibaba and its peers such as Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) have been aggressively developing their own AI models in recent months. Similar to models that power popular chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, Llama2 is a large machine learning model that has been trained on a vast amount of data to generate coherent and natural-sounding outputs. According to Meta, Llama2 will be free to use for companies with fewer than 700 million monthly active users. Programs with more users will need to seek a license from Meta. Alibaba also added that if a client wants to use Llama2 to provide services to the Chinese public, it will need to comply with Chinese laws and steer clear of practice and content that may harm the country.

But expect deeper investments before gains trickle to the bottom line, the companies said on Tuesday. Microsoft said costs rose sharply as it built new data centers to support AI and that capital expenditures will continue to rise as it buys chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to power those data centers. The Windows maker's shares were down more than 3% on Wednesday, while Alphabet gained nearly 7%. Microsoft is bearing AI costs in two ways, analysts said: to power its own products such as its forthcoming $30-a-month Copilot AI assistant, and to serve companies wanting to use its Azure cloud computing services to create AI products. Microsoft executives said the service will start generating the bulk of its revenue in the second half of its fiscal 2024 ending June 30. ""They're buying a bunch of H100s,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst of Creative Strategies, referring to Nvidia's flagship chips for AI. ""You're probably going to see a similar thing with Amazon (AMZN.O), if not this quarter then the next quarter, because both of them are the clouds that the vast majority of the market is using for training (AI systems) right now."" Alphabet, however, kept down costs, though not for long. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who will become president and chief investment officer, said delays in data center construction are why second-quarter capex was lower than expected. ""As far as AI is concerned, while Google may have spent upwards of $200 billion on AI investments over the past decade, much of that isn't necessarily appreciated by users and investors,"" said Scott Kessler, global sector lead for technology media and telecommunications at Third Bridge. One advantage Google has, analysts said, is that it has its own custom chip for handling AI work called the Tensor Processor Unit (TPU), which helps lower costs. Microsoft may be ""aggressively buying Nvidia chips, given Microsoft does not have its own silicon as an alternative,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. But Google conceded that it will buy chips from other companies as well as using its own, and Porat said that spending could put a drag on profit and growth.

Jefferies was among the 27 brokerages that raised their price targets, with several of them saying AI had started to contribute to Google's cloud revenue and helped drive a 28% growth in the quarter that widely surpassed expectations. Alphabet has rolled out a series of AI products this year and revamped its search engine with the technology as it competes with Microsoft in a race to dominate the nascent field.

Meta Platforms (META.O) stands out among company earnings reports due on Wednesday in the United States, which also include AT&T (T.N), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO.N), U.S. railroad operator Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), eBay (EBAY.O), Boeing (BA.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N). Both Microsoft and Alphabet announced strong earnings results after the U.S. close on Tuesday. In Europe, France-based retail distributor Carrefour and global foods and beverage company Danone (DANO.PA) report, as do GSK (GSK.L) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI). In Asia, markets are awaiting details on fresh economic stimulus measures from China following the Politburo's pledge on Monday to step up policy support for the faltering economy. Chinese stock markets were mostly lower on Wednesday following a steep rally the day before. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (.HSI) fell 0.8%, trailed by its property and tech subindexes. China's blue-chip CSI300 (.CSI300) index was down 0.3% while the CSI 300 Real Estate index gained 0.2%. Australian CPI data released on Wednesday showed inflation slowed more than expected in the June quarter, giving the Aussie a knock but allowing the Reserve Bank of Australia some breathing room before its next policy meeting on Aug. 1.

23,2023-07-26,0.9879,"2023-07-26Morning Bid: Tech splits, banks merge and Fed decides|A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Alphabet outshone Microsoft as the latest two of the tech giants reported earnings overnight, with another regional bank merger exciting financial stocks as the Fed decides on interest rates. The blizzard of market-moving news has done little to rein in the relentless climb of Wall St stocks so far this week, with the S&P500 (.SPX) hitting new highs for the year and the Dow Jones bluechips index (.DJI) clocking a 12th straight daily gain on Tuesday for the first time in six years. Unlucky for some perhaps, but a 13th today would make it the longest winning streak for the Dow since 1987. But this year's supercharged tech sector (.NDX), (.NYFANG) has been more hesitant in returning to the year's highs as its leading lights dish out earnings updates, with a high bar to impress given the scale of AI-infused share price already in 2023. Tesla and Netflix stumbled last week despite headline profit beats and Microsoft's (MSFT.O) ostensible forecast-beating earnings were the latest to underwhelm overnight, as disappointing projections for its cloud business sent its stock down 4% out of hours. Snap plunged 20% before the bell as its guidance fell short too. It not impossible to wow the gallery though. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) climbed 7% after hours as its results beat was accompanied by a surprising rebound in advertising and warmer words on its cloud operations. Meta Platforms (META.O) is up next after Wednesday's closing bell and its share rose 2%. Amazon (AMZN.O) lost 2% on reports the Federal Trade Commission is finalizing an antitrust lawsuit against the firm. The net impact on overall index futures has been marginal so far on Wednesday - a tick down in Nasdaq and Dow futures and a modest nudge up in S&P500. The wider market is held in check awaiting the Federal Reserve's latest quarter-point interest rate rise to 22-year highs of 5.25-5.50%, possibly its last in the cycle if futures are correct. U.S. two-year Treasury yields retreated into the decision and the dollar (.DXY) dialed back too. In the background, the regional bank sector was enlivened by more merger activity. Shares in PacWest (PACW.O) rose nearly 38% in premarket trading after news that smaller rival Banc of California (BANC.N), which rose 14%, had agreed to buy the lender for $1.1 billion. Wells Fargo (WFC.N), meantime, climbed 2.8% after the bank's board authorized a new $30 billion share buyback program. The Fed decision comes in the wake of another set of forecast-beating U.S. consumer confidence readings for July. Economists assume the central bank will retain a hawkish tone but keep its options on another hike open as it will have almost two months of data to assess before meeting again on September 20. Elsewhere, the European earnings season was in full swing too, with banks dominating the diary and the European Central Bank meeting tomorrow. Deutsche Bank < DBKGn.DE> stock fell 1% after the lender reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit as an investment banking slump offset higher interest income. With the Bank of Japan also meeting this week, the yen fell back after a top government official quoted BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda as saying he will maintain accommodative monetary conditions. This week's China's stock rebound (.CSI300) also cooled amid a lack of detail around the Politburo's economic stimulus plans and as property worries continued to rankle. Trading of Chinese property developer Country Garden's (2007.HK) bonds was halted after a more than 20% drop in price on Wednesday. Events to watch for on Wednesday: * U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision, followed by press conference from Chair Jerome Powell * U.S. corporate earnings: Meta Platforms, eBay, Boeing, General Dynamics, AT&T, Seagate, Union Pacific, CME, Hilton Worldwide, Coca-Cola, Molina, Ameriprise, Lam Research, ADP, Allegion, Fiserv, American Water Works, United Rentals, Otis, Everest, Align, Globe Life, Rollins, Edwards Lifesciences etc * U.S. June new home sales * U.S. Treasury auctions 2-year floating rate notes Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9879"

In particular, memory chip demand from corporate buyers stocking AI data centres as well as gaming personal computers is expected to increase in the second half of the year, the world's second-biggest memory chip maker said. Microsoft (MSFT.O), a key client for such chips, on Tuesday laid out an aggressive spending plan throughout fiscal 2024 to meet demand for its new AI services after reporting a sharp rise in costs from building new data centres. ""We have long-range visibility (on AI-driven demand) from our clients into next year,"" Myoungsoo Park, SK Hynix's head of DRAM marketing said in an earnings call. Memory chip makers cut production in the first half of this year as prices continued to fall due to slumping demand from buyers amid economic headwinds, causing steep writedowns to the value of unsold stockpiles. Market conditions remain mixed depending on the type of chips. SK Hynix said on Wednesday it would cut production of its NAND Flash chips used for data storage by a further 5% to 10% because of high inventories and low profitability amid a fall in the average sales price. SK Hynix reported a 2.9 trillion won ($2.28 billion) operating loss in the June quarter, down from 4.2 trillion won profit a year earlier on weak memory chip pricing and demand. Revenue fell 47% year-on-year to 7.31 trillion won in the June quarter. But a boom in AI helped it boost sales of high-end DRAM chips in the second quarter and narrow losses from the record 3.4 trillion won reported in the first quarter. SK Hynix said demand for AI server memory had more than doubled in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Its DRAM chips, which hold information from applications while the system is in use, sold for a higher price in the second quarter versus the first, on average. SK Hynix leads the market in high bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM used in the fast-growing field of generative AI. It had a 50% market share in HBM as of 2022, followed by Samsung Electronics' (005930.KS) 40% and Micron's (MU.O) 10%, according to TrendForce. HBM can feed more data into chips used for generative AI, enabling them to compute at high speed. SK Hynix's DRAM business is expected to swing to a profit in the fourth quarter thanks to strong sales of premium products such as HBM and high-density DDR5 chips, said Greg Roh, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities. ""But NAND Flash demand from Chinese mobile firms may continue to stagnate until year-end,"" leaving the chip maker's return to full profit uncertain, he added. The company said its 2024 capital expenditure would be higher than this year, when its slashed budget by at least 50% from 2022, with a continued focus on matching the mix of chips it makes to market conditions instead of expanding capacity. SK Hynix shares reversed initial gains to fall 0.4% in morning trade, versus the wider market's (.KS11) 0.3% drop. The company's shares have risen more than 50% year-to-date on investor hopes for a market recovery early in the second half, but its comments pointed to a later rebound in NAND Flash and older DRAM chip demand, said Nam Dae-jong, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities. Samsung, the world's biggest memory chip maker, will report its detailed second-quarter financial results on Thursday. Samsung shares were down 2% in morning trade.

Both Microsoft and Alphabet have launched an array of AI products since OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released ChatGPT in late 2022. Investors expect the new products will help tech giants offset a slowdown in their cloud businesses. Shares in the owner of Google and the maker of Windows climbed 0.6% and 1.7%, respectively. ""When you have this much enthusiasm for a specific investing theme, you don't need much of a reason for markets to move. It's inertia,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. With the U.S. central bank on track for another 25-basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday, policymakers face a choice over how much weight to put on recent economic data. ""The Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow is reminding the market that it will be the second to last, if not the last, interest rate increase, and that has been a major concern for markets, particularly for tech stocks,"" said Rishi Sadarangani, chief investment officer at hedge fund R/Evolution Gate. A survey showed consumer confidence increased to a two-year high in July, amid continued optimism about the labor market despite worries about a recession. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index (.IXIC) has rallied this year, helped by outsized gains in rate-sensitive megacap growth companies and hopes for an end to the U.S. Federal Reserve's tightening cycle. Companies outside tech are also performing well as lower valuations attract investors. The blue-chip Dow (.DJI) inched up for 13th day in a row, even as a 0.87% slide in Boeing (BA.N) capped gains. RTX (RTX.N) tumbled 10.2% after saying many of its Pratt & Whitney GTF engines that power Airbus A320neo jets will need ""accelerated removals and inspections"". The S&P composite 1500 passenger airlines sub index (.SPCOMAIR) dropped 3.45%, bogged down by a 9.7% fall in Alaska Air (ALK.N) after the airline's annual revenue growth outlook missed expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 26.83 points, or 0.08%, to 35,438.07, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 12.82 points, or 0.28%, to 4,567.46 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 85.69 points, or 0.61%, to 14,144.56. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.75 billion shares, compared with the 10.32 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Most of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were subdued. But materials stocks gained 1.76%, tracking rising metal prices as investors cheered pledges of support from a politburo meeting in China. General Electric (GE.N) jumped 6.27% after raising its annual adjusted profit forecast, while General Motors (GM.N) slumped 3.51% after it posted a decline in adjusted pre-tax profit and margins in its key North American market from the previous quarter. 3M Co (MMM.N) rose 5.33% as the industrial conglomerate raised its annual adjusted profit forecast. The S&P 500 earnings are now expected to decline 7.7% for the second quarter, as per Refinitiv data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 101 new lows. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

26,2023-07-25,0.9857,"2023-07-25Microsoft charges ahead with spending to serve AI demand|July 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Tuesday laid out an aggressive spending plan to meet demand for its new artificial intelligence services after surpassing Wall Street estimates for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and profit. Costs rose sharply as Microsoft built new data centers to support AI, and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on a conference call with analysts the company's capital expenditures would continue rising each quarter throughout fiscal 2024. Shares fell about 4% in after-hours trade. Wall Street is looking at how generative AI services may benefit Microsoft, which secured an early lead with investments in OpenAI, owner of the popular ChatGPT service. Microsoft is weaving AI into its own products, such as the $30-a-month ""Copilot"" assistant for its Microsoft 365 service that can summarize a day's worth of emails into a quick update. It is also aiming to sell cloud computing services that other firms will use to build AI services. Microsoft's results show heavy spending on AI services ahead of commensurate revenue growth. While its Azure sales growth slightly exceeded market expectations, Microsoft's quarterly capital expenditures hit the highest single-quarter total since at least its fiscal 2016. The company is battling other cloud providers for a limited supply of chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), whose graphics processing units are essential for creating AI products and services. CFO Hood told analysts that despite Microsoft's increased spending in fiscal 2024, operating profit margins would grow slightly after adjusting for the effects of an accounting rule change. ""The real focus here is being able to be aggressive in meeting the demand curve,"" Hood said. It will take time to make money, Hood said, noting that Copilot is not ready for general release and any revenues from the product are likely to happen toward the second half of fiscal 2024. Microsoft forecast Azure revenue growth of 25%-26% in constant currency for the fiscal first quarter, compared with an estimate of 25.6% from Visible Alpha that does not adjust for foreign exchange rates. For the segment that includes Azure, Microsoft forecast a first-quarter revenue range with a midpoint of $23.45 billion. Analysts on average estimated $23.55 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The midpoint of its first-quarter forecast for the segment containing Office was $18.15 billion, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $18.08 billion. Microsoft's forecast for its Windows segment had a midpoint of $12.7 billion, below analysts' estimate of $13.14 billion. Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 rose to $56.2 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $55.5 billion according to Refinitiv. Net income was $2.69 per share, above the $2.55 average estimate. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses the Azure cloud computing platform, increased its revenue to $24 billion slightly topped expectations according to Refinitiv data. Azure revenue rose 26%, beating a 25.2% growth estimate from Visible Alpha. Microsoft does not break out a precise quarterly revenue figure for Azure, the part of its business best situated to capitalize on booming interest in AI. But Chief Executive Satya Nadella said on a conference call that Azure accounted for more than half of the $110 billion for ""Microsoft Cloud"" in fiscal 2023, putting Azure sales at $55 billion or more and revealing the size of the business for the first time. The company is still navigating a PC business slump with sales, including of its Windows operating system, falling to $13.9 billion. The segment with the LinkedIn social network and its Office productivity software increased sales to $18.3 billion. Both segments slightly topped the average analyst estimate, according to Refinitiv data. Capital expenditures jumped to $10.7 billion from $7.8 billion in the fiscal third quarter, after the company told investors spending would rise as it builds out data centers for AI work. Microsoft has started integrating AI functionality across its products such as Azure, Microsoft 365, GitHub and several developer tools. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9857"

Alphabet's results were helped by steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising. The shares jumped 8% in after-hours trading. Shares of rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) were down slightly after it also reported results on Tuesday, while shares of Meta Platforms (META.O), a company also highly dependent on ad sales, rose as much as 2%. ""Not only did Google deliver fantastic earnings per share, exceeding expectations at a time when investors were questioning its ability to keep up with other tech giants amid the AI frenzy, it also did so by a considerable margin,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""This strongly indicates that a new growth phase for the giant is likely under way."" He added, ""Google has finally consolidated itself as a leading force in the highly-disputed cloud sector and now has room to focus its expansion in the AI field."" Porat, hired in 2015, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent female executives and oversaw tremendous growth at Alphabet. She will become chief investment officer and president starting Sept. 1 and lead 2024 planning while her successor is sought. Porat was hired from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), where she was finance chief. In her new role, she will oversee the company’s so-called Other Bets portfolio, the unit for more risky hardware and services ventures, as well as help manage the company’s global investments. Advertisers, who make up a big share of Alphabet's revenue, have pulled back on spending precious dollars on untested platforms, helping the Google parent as well as Facebook owner Meta Platforms. But Alphabet's second-quarter results are sure to please investors concerned over a broader advertiser pullback following the meteoric growth of Web services during the pandemic, as consumers returned to physical retail. Silicon Valley has been buzzing over generative artificial intelligence software that can give long-winded responses to user queries and is predicted to be the next leap forward for Big Tech. Alphabet rolled out AI products at its annual I/O developer conference in May and it revamped its search engine to include generative AI. The new AI technology comes at a cost: the largest component of Alphabet's second-quarter capital spending was for servers and a ""meaningful investment"" in AI computing, Porat said in a conference call. Advertising is coming to the company's revamped search, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on the call. Alphabet is testing what formats are effective and where to place ads inside of its AI-powered search. Presently, 80% of advertisers use at least one AI-driven search product, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said on the call. The company plans to integrate generative AI into other products such as Gmail, Google Photos and its Android mobile operating system. Generative AI tech can create text, images and video that resemble what people produce. Still, the results released on Tuesday show that ad sales are still king. Investors punished social media company Snap (SNAP.N) on Tuesday for its disappointing ad sales in the quarter. Revenue at Google Cloud, which is among the biggest cloud service providers, rose 28% to $8.1 billion, besting expectations of $7.75 billion, and maintaining roughly the same rate of growth as the first quarter. Microsoft's Azure revenue rose 26%, ahead of the growth estimate from Visible Alpha. Analysts and industry experts have said they expect cloud business growth to pick up toward the end of the year, with quarter-ended June being the trough as macro uncertainty begins to clear. Investors expect AI to become a major growth driver for cloud businesses within a year, with Microsoft's Azure leading the pack followed by Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) AWS and Google Cloud. Ad sales for Google's YouTube video service unit rose 4.4% to $7.67 billion. Alphabet reported net profit of $1.44 per share for the April-June period, compared with estimates of $1.34 per share. Revenue for the quarter stood at $74.6 billion, compared with estimates of $72.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

28,2023-07-25,0.9933,"2023-07-25Morning Bid: China hopes, U.S. big tech fire up markets|July 26 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. Asian stock markets will open strongly on Wednesday if the previous day's China- and U.S.-fueled momentum doesn't wilt, as investors brace for a triple whammy of major central bank policy decisions over the coming 72 hours. On the regional data front, Australian consumer inflation grabs the spotlight. Economists expect inflation to have slowed in June and over the second quarter, which could lean investors toward thinking interest rates have peaked at 4.10%. It's not often China is the source of much optimism for investors these days, but that it exactly where markets find themselves after the country's top leaders on Monday pledged to ramp up support for the struggling economy. China's blue chip equity index rose nearly 3% for its best day this year, and Chinese property stocks surged 8% for their biggest rise this year too. Hong Kong's main property stocks index jumped 14%, the biggest rise since March last year. Beijing's top policy-making Politburo said it will implement macro adjustments ""in a precise and forceful manner"" to support an economy undergoing a ""tortuous"" post-COVID recovery. Fine words and sentiment, but as analysts at Investec note, no details on actual policies were forthcoming. This is what will determine China's recovery, so until more clarity emerges, investors' optimism may fade as quickly as it appeared. The mainland property index is still down 13% this year and the Hong Kong-based index is down 25%. Maybe they are cheap enough to draw in buyers, but the problems run deep. That said, MSCI's Asia ex-Japan equity index on Tuesday ended a six-day losing streak and rallied 2%. The MSCI World index rose for the 10th session of the last 12, reaching its highest level since April last year, and the S&P 500 also climbed to a new 15-month high. Surprisingly strong U.S. consumer confidence, growing faith in an economic 'soft landing', and the Artificial Intelligence buzz around juicy earnings reports from Big Tech firms all contributed to the latest Wall Street rally. Strong results from Microsoft and Alphabet after the bell will only strengthen the upbeat tone in Asia on Wednesday too. All this comes ahead of the first of three major central bank policy decisions this week - the Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates 25 basis points on Wednesday, followed by a similar move from the European Central Bank on Thursday and the Bank of Japan holding the line on Friday.

29,2023-07-25,0.8591,"2023-07-25Twitter blue bird has flown as Musk says X logo is here|July 24 (Reuters) - After 17 years with an iconic blue bird that came to symbolize the broadcasting of ideas to the world, billionaire Elon Musk renamed Twitter as X and unveiled a new logo, marking a focus on building an ""everything app."" On Monday, a stylized white X on a black background became the new logo on Twitter's website, though the blue bird was still seen on the mobile app. Since taking over Twitter in October, Musk has said he envisions an app that could offer a variety of services to users beyond social media, such as peer-to-peer payments, an idea that mirrors the widely popular WeChat app in China. The transformation is more simply a way for Musk to make his mark on the company, said Tom Morton, global chief strategy officer at ad agency R/GA. ""Twitter's changing name and logo has nothing to do with user, advertiser, or market issues. It's a symbol that Twitter is Elon Musk's personal property. ""He conquered the castle, now he's flying his own flag."" The new logo garnered mixed reactions from users and sparked confusion about what tweets would now be called, while marketing and branding experts said the rebrand risked throwing away years of Twitter's name recognition. ""Only a few brands have become verbs or seen themselves referred to in global news outlets as often as Twitter has,"" said Matt Rhodes, strategy lead at creative agency House 337, which has worked with British telecom company Sky. ""Anything that makes it harder for people to find, or want to open the app on their cluttered phone screens risks harming usage,"" he said. Fernando Machado, who previously held chief marketing officer roles at Activision Blizzard, Restaurant Brands International and Burger King, said rebrands typically take time to sink in, though ""as a Twitter user, I confess that I miss the little bird already."" ""Personally, I think the new approach feels a bit cold and impersonal,"" he said. Outside Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco on Monday, police stopped construction workers from removing the Twitter sign, in a scene witnessed by a Reuters reporter. On one side of the building, only the blue bird and the letters ""er"" were left. ""#GoodbyeTwitter"" was trending on the platform on Monday with reference to the old logo as some users criticized the new one. Musk tweeted on Saturday that ""soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds"". [1/8]A partially dismantled Twitter's sign is seen at Twitter's corporate headquarters building as Elon Musk renamed Twitter as X and unveiled a new logo, in downtown San Francisco, California, U.S., July 24, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria In response to a tweet asking what will tweets be called under X, Musk replied ""x's"". Musk has used the letter X repeatedly across his companies. He co-founded x.com as an online bank in 1999 which later transformed into PayPal. He bought the domain back from PayPal in 2017, saying it had ""sentimental value"". The domain x.com now redirects to Twitter. Linda Yaccarino, the former advertising chief at NBCUniversal who started as Twitter CEO on June 5, told employees in a memo on Monday that X ""will go even further to transform the global town square."" The company will work on new features in audio, video, messaging, payments and banking, according to the memo, which was seen by Reuters. The platform will face challenges to reinvent its business. Since Musk's takeover, the company has faced tumultuous times with layoffs, a sharp drop in advertisers and the meteoric rise of Threads, Meta's response to Twitter. The billionaire's decision to rebrand Twitter as X could be complicated legally: X is widely used and cited in trademarks, and companies including Meta and Microsoft already have intellectual property rights to the same letter. The rebrand indicates Musk has given up on any plans ""to revive Twitter as a powerful stand-alone social network and simply considers the $44 billion spent on the network a sunk cost,"" said Niklas Myhr, a professor of marketing at Chapman University. ""The last few months have been tumultuous at Twitter, and I don't think a new brand is going to solve everything,"" Drew Benvie, CEO of social media consultancy Battenhall, said. ""This is less about reinventing Twitter, and more about building a brand around Elon Musk's empire, including SpaceX, where the X branding really connects a little more closely.""

Fed officials are gathering for their July monetary policy meeting, starting on Tuesday, where the central bank's rate-tightening cycle will be top of the agenda. Most market participants expect the Fed to deliver a 25 basis-point rate hike when the meeting concludes on Wednesday. U.S. Treasury yields advanced, with benchmark 10-year notes rising to 3.890% while rate-sensitive two-year notes were up at 4.8806%. Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are among U.S. technology giants whose quarterly earnings on Tuesday give investors a glimpse of the health of the U.S. economy. The performance of these megacap tech companies underlies the nearly 19% year-to-date rally in the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX). After the bell on Tuesday, Alphabet said second-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street expectations. Microsoft on Tuesday surpassed Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit as its cloud business benefited from product upgrades featuring new artificial intelligence (AI) technology. ""There's a bit of catch-your-breath mentality before what could really be a big market moving event with the big Fed meeting tomorrow,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. ""At the same time, the Fed is important but corporate earnings matter. Overall, it's been fairly positive and people expect earnings to come in better than expected,"" Detrick said. The MSCI All-World index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks equities in more than 50 countries, rose 0.47%.

31,2023-07-25,0.9233,"2023-07-25US dollar flat as market awaits clarity from central banks|NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - The dollar was flat against a basket of its major peers on Tuesday, as investors hope a trio of central bank meetings this week will provide guidance on the outlook for monetary policy. Signs of an extremely resilient U.S. economy helped the currency recover from a recent 15-month low, as well as persistent weakness in Europe. U.S. consumer confidence increased to a two-year high in July amid a persistently tight labor market and receding inflation, bolstering the economy's prospects in the near term. Still, the economy is not out of the woods, with the survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday offering mixed signals. Consumers remain fearful of a recession over the next year following hefty interest-rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve. ""There was a lot of anticipation that we were going to get consolidation leading up to the Fed, and for the most part, risk appetite has been hanging in there. What we're probably going to see is the forex market is really going to have to have a wait and see approach,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in New York. ""We might have an initial move post Fed, but we then have to really pay close attention to not just ECB but also the BOJ. So, I think FX volatility should still remain elevated, and that's why we're not seeing a lot of positioning on the day like today."" The dollar index fell 0.108% to 101.280, after hitting a two-week peak earlier of 101.65. The euro fell for a fifth successive session, and was down 0.13% to $1.1048 as evidence of a slowdown in Europe builds after a recent survey showed demand for loans in the euro zone hitting a record low in the second quarter, and separate data showed deterioration of business confidence in Germany this month. This follows disappointing Purchasing Manager Indexes on Monday that came in below expectations for the euro zone as a whole. Markets have plenty more to watch as the Fed concludes a rate-setting meeting on Wednesday, followed by the European Central Bank (ECB) a day later and the Bank of Japan on Friday, as well as earnings from heavyweight companies. Both Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are due on Tuesday. ""In the last week or so, there have been wobbles on market views about both the outcomes for the Fed and the ECB in September and investors will be looking for some clarity from policymakers this week – though it cannot be assumed that this will be provided,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank London. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.38% versus the greenback at 140.92 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2896, up 0.50% . In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin last rose 0.42% to $29,261.22.

32,2023-07-25,0.9819,"2023-07-25Meme stocks surge as tech rally gets too pricey for retail investors|July 24 (Reuters) - Meme stocks have surged in the last few weeks as retail investors shun pricier stocks for cheaper speculative names, but some experts worry that this could choke the current rally in broader markets. At a time when the wider rally has made some stocks, especially in the tech space, too expensive, the return of meme stocks is offering retail investors a more affordable option to participate in 2023's market rebound and pocket big returns. Roundhill's Meme index (.MEME) hit a one-year high last week and was last up 60% for 2023 so far, dwarfing gains of more than 18% recorded by the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX). The NYSE FANG+ index (.NYFANG), housing megacap technology and growth stocks like Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), has climbed 77% so far this year. ""Some of the retail animal spirits are coming back, but it's a little bit more complex than the first time around,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital. ""There's widespread panic-buying and catch-up trade from those who risk going into the year-end flat while the S&P is up 18%."" Retail investors poured in $1.27 billion per day on average into U.S. equities in July, closing in on the all-time record of $1.5 billion a day in March, Vanda Research said. ""What we have seen historically is that when short squeezes are happening in some of these zombie-like companies that are burning cash or in really beaten down names, that's usually more indicative of a sign of the end of the bull market as opposed to beginning,"" said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst at Triple D Trading. The meme index consists of 25 equal-weighted U.S.-listed stocks with a combination of elevated social media activity and high short interest. It is rebalanced every two weeks. Recent examples of rallies include a 33% jump in shares of cinema operator AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) on Monday and a 40% rise in shares of troubled used-car retailer Carvana (CVNA.N) last Wednesday. Net retail investor flows into Carvana hit their highest in over a year last week, before sliding a little on profit-taking, according to data by Vanda Research, while flows into AMC touched 11-month highs on Monday. Shares of Carvana, which is also the top holding of Roundhill's meme index with a nearly 5% weighting, are up about 850% so far this year but are still far from their all-time highs hit during the meme stock mania of 2021. About 28.1% of AMC's publicly available shares are under short position, according to data by analytics firm Ortex, while 55.2% of Carvana's free float shares are shorted.

As AI becomes widely used in tasks such as content writing to coding, San Francisco-based OpenAI announced ChatGPT for Android last week to further expand its user base. ChatGPT, which was launched by the Sam Altman-led company in November last year, has been available on Apple's (AAPL.O) iOS platform since May. The viral success of ChatGPT has triggered a wave of enthusiasm in AI, prompting companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) to pour billions of dollars into the technology.

35,2023-07-25,0.9502,"2023-07-25Morning Bid: Big Tech litmus test as Fed gather|A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Buoyant Wall St stocks brace for a critical test of this year's extraordinary surge in Big Tech shares as Microsoft and Alphabet both report after the bell on Tuesday, just as Federal Reserve officials kick off their two-day policy meeting. The mood on world markets generally was lifted by a bounce-back in ailing Chinese stocks - a delayed reaction to Monday's somewhat vague statement from the country's ruling Politburo on supporting the ""tortuous"" economic recovery there. The 4% snapback in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HSI) - still down almost 2% for the year - was driven by a 12% surge in the beaten-down property sector (.HSMPI) but only brought the overall benchmark back to where it was on July 14. The wider blue-chip CSI 300 Index (.CSI300) snapped a six-day losing streak to pop 3% and buying from state banks propped the yuan. In sweltering Europe, the tone was more subdued as a survey of big banks by the European Central Bank - also meeting this week - showed business demand for loans dropped in the second quarter to their lowest in the 20-year history of the poll as credit conditions tightened further. German business confidence sagged again this month too. Euro/dollar slipped further after the reports. All of which painted a confusing picture of the global demand pulse going into the Fed meeting, with Monday's news of ebbing U.S. business sentiment in July at least showing overall growth in activity - in contrast to the euro zone contraction. A jump in crude oil prices to three-month highs on Monday - due to a major U.S. refinery outage and background China stimulus hopes - was twinned with a 10 basis-point spike in two-year Treasury yields on a downbeat auction to add to the messy dashboard. Both oil and Treasury yields gave back some of those gains again today, however, with year-on-year crude price declines still tracking more than 21%. S&P500 and Nasdaq stock futures pushed higher, after fresh Wall St gains on Monday that saw Dow Jones bluechips (.DJI) clock an 11-day winning streak for the first time in more than six years. VIX (.VIX) volatility gauges subsided from two-week highs. There was little ostensible reaction to the formal rebalancing of the Nasdaq 100 (.NDX) index that pared weightings of several of the big caps to reduce ""over-concentration"". With the earnings season in full swing, investors now focus on readouts from mega caps Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) after the bell on Tuesday - with the bar high after this year's AI-infused stock surges and sky-high valuations. The approach of Wednesday's Fed decision may limit market moves until then. As it stands, futures are fully priced for another quarter-point rate hike to the 5.25-5.50% range - and still see this as likely the last in the cycle as markets indicate less than a 50% chance of another move later in the year. Easing expectations for 12 months time are gradually being reined in however.

36,2023-07-25,0.9484,"2023-07-25Meta, Microsoft, hundreds more own trademarks to new Twitter name|July 24 (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk's decision to rebrand Twitter as X could be complicated legally: companies including Meta (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) already have intellectual property rights to the same letter. X is so widely used and cited in trademarks that it is a candidate for legal challenges - and the company formerly known as Twitter could face its own issues defending its X brand in the future. ""There's a 100% chance that Twitter is going to get sued over this by somebody,"" said trademark attorney Josh Gerben, who said he counted nearly 900 active U.S. trademark registrations that already cover the letter X in a wide range of industries. Musk renamed social media network Twitter as X on Monday and unveiled a new logo for the social media platform, a stylized black-and-white version of the letter. Owners of trademarks - which protect things like brand names, logos and slogans that identify sources of goods - can claim infringement if other branding would cause consumer confusion. Remedies range from monetary damages to blocking use. Microsoft since 2003 has owned an X trademark related to communications about its Xbox video-game system. Meta Platforms - whose Threads platform is a new Twitter rival - owns a federal trademark registered in 2019 covering a blue-and-white letter ""X"" for fields including software and social media. Meta and Microsoft likely would not sue unless they feel threatened that Twitter's X encroaches on brand equity they built in the letter, Gerben said. The three companies did not respond to requests for comment. Meta itself drew intellectual property challenges when it changed its name from Facebook. It faces trademark lawsuits filed last year by investment firm Metacapital and virtual-reality company MetaX, and settled another over its new infinity-symbol logo. And if Musk succeeds in changing the name, others still could claim 'X' for themselves. ""Given the difficulty in protecting a single letter, especially one as popular commercially as 'X', Twitter's protection is likely to be confined to very similar graphics to their X logo,"" said Douglas Masters, a trademark attorney at law firm Loeb & Loeb. ""The logo does not have much distinctive about it, so the protection will be very narrow."" Insider reported earlier that Meta had an X trademark, and lawyer Ed Timberlake tweeted that Microsoft had one as well. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Visa (V.N), recruiter Robert Half (RHI.N), General Electric (GE.N), 3M (MMM.N), Dow (DOW.N), chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN.O) and grain dealer Archer-Daniel Midlands (ADM.N) are among the heavyweights and highlights in the United States. Unilever (ULVR.L), LVMH and EssilorLuxottica (ESLX.PA) report in London and Paris. The corporate performance and outlook risk disappointing markets that are increasingly priced for a ""soft-landing"" slowdown in both growth and inflation. In the Asia session investors cheered pledges of support in the readout from an earlier-than-expected Politburo meeting in China -- though not too loudly. Property stocks in Hong Kong surged, only they had spent much of the past week or two descending deeper into the discount cellar so gains came from a low base. The Hang Seng (.HSI) rose about 3% and the Shanghai Composite (.SSEC) roughly 2%, but neither is roaring out of recent ranges. The yuan jumped, but it had help from China's state banks, which sources said were buying onshore and offshore early in the Asian day. Morgan Stanley analysts made much of the absence in the readout of a familiar line that ""property is for living not for speculation"" and the addition of a pledge to ""optimise"" policy. ""Investors should recall that the early stage of COVID easing was labelled as 'optimised' policy, which led to a complete change of the policy later,"" they wrote. Traders are buying it today, but may not do so tomorrow while a cash crunch looms over giant names like Country Garden and Dalian Wanda.

""What you're seeing now is people broadening the breadth of the market,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ""People are starting to maybe take some profits (in tech) and invest in other parts of the markets that they might see a little bit better bargain."" Investors are awaiting Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) earnings this week, which will show whether their stocks justify sky-high valuations. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC) has rallied 34.3% this year, outperforming its peers as rate-sensitive megacap growth companies rose on optimism about artificial intelligence and an end to the Fed's tightening cycle. The Nasdaq (.NDX) lagged other indexes as investors looked to non-tech stocks for bargains, lifting sectors from energy to banks. Helping the Dow (.DJI) notch its longest winning streak since February 2017, Chevron (CVX.N) gained almost 2% as the oil giant posted upbeat preliminary quarterly earnings over the weekend. As of Friday, second-quarter earnings are expected to decline by 7.9%, Refinitiv data showed. Investors ignored a survey showing July U.S. business activity had slowed to a five-month low, dragged down by decelerating service-sector growth. ""You've got an increasing belief that soft landing and an increasingly dovish Fed may occur,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer with the BMO Family Office, adding some sideline cash is coming back to stocks. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its policy-making meeting on Wednesday. A majority of economists polled by Reuters expect this to be the last hike of the current tightening cycle, after data this month showed signs of disinflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 183.55 points, or 0.52%, to 35,411.24, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 18.3 points, or 0.40%, to 4,554.64 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 26.06 points, or 0.19%, to 14,058.87. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.43 billion shares, compared with the 10.30 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by a gain in energy stocks (.SPNY). Toymaker Mattel (MAT.O) rose 1.8% as the ""Barbie"" movie set a record as the biggest domestic debut of 2023. AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) jumped 32.9% after a judge blocked the theater chain's stock conversion plan that risked diluting investors' holdings in the company. AMC's preferred shares closed flat. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies like Alibaba and JD.com rose 4.5% and 3.5% respectively as its top leaders announced economic policy adjustments to expand domestic demand.

An overwhelming majority of traders expect the Fed to raise rates by 25 basis points at its policy meeting this week, according to CME Group data, helping to revive concerns of a looming recession following resilient U.S. economic growth. The European Central Bank is also expected to maintain a hawkish stance when it meets this week, while the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its super-loose monetary policy intact after its meeting. The yields on 10-year notes were at 3.874%, rebounding from an early session decline, while the rate-sensitive two-year yields were up at 4.8917%. Yet, markets are also anticipating buoyant results from major U.S. companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), whose performance has mostly underpinned the nearly 19% year-to-date gain in the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX). ""The most over-used phrase in this industry is 'cautiously optimistic' but that is where we are,"" said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund. ""We still think that in general the economy is going to be growing but there will be continued rolling recessions of segments of the economy, which is really healthy because it tends to lead to significant long-term bull markets,"" Plumb said. The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up 0.21%, while European stocks (.STOXX) added just 0.06%. On Wall Street, the three main indexes closed higher, led by gains in financial, consumer discretionary, technology and energy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.52% to 35,411.24, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.40% to 4,554.64 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 0.19% to 14,058.87. ""The consensus is for the Fed to raise by 25 basis points and then some more indication that they could be at the end. We don't have much insight that it would be different but if it is, then it would dramatically increase the volatility of markets,"" Plumb added. The U.S. dollar edged up against major currencies after economic data continued to show the resilience of the American economy compared to its peers. The purchasing managers' survey showed on Monday that U.S. business activity slowed to a five-month low in July, dragged down by decelerating service sector growth, but the data was better than similar surveys out of Europe. The dollar index rose 0.297%, with the euro down 0.56% to $1.1061.

40,2023-07-24,0.9697,"2023-07-24FBI searched foreign intelligence database for information on US senator|WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The FBI improperly conducted warrantless searches for information about a U.S. senator and two state officials, a U.S. intelligence agency revealed on Friday, as lawmakers are weighing whether to renew the surveillance power that makes such searches possible. The names of the U.S. senator, the state senator and the state judge targeted were not disclosed. The disclosure by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) followed a secret court order reauthorizing the use of Section 702 - the part of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that allows the FBI to scour the vast troves of intelligence data for information that might be useful for its own investigations. The April 11 court order was declassified earlier this week and published on the ODNI's blog on Friday. The order said that while the Federal Bureau of Investigation analyst who sought the two lawmakers' data had information that they were being pursued by an unidentified foreign intelligence service, the search was still improper. It is not clear why the FBI sought to put the judge - who had complained to the bureau about alleged civil rights violations perpetrated by an unnamed police chief - under surveillance. The FBI did not immediately return emails seeking the target's identities or further comment on the targeting. Despite the missteps, the FBI was praised by the judge involved for doing ""a better job"" at curbing surveillance abuses. Section 702 expires at the end of the year and intelligence chiefs - including President Joe Biden's nominee for the National Security Agency - have championed its renewal in the face of skepticism from lawmakers in both parties. That skepticism only deepened when an earlier court order - declassified in May - revealed that the FBI had improperly searched for the foreign intelligence database more than a quarter million times over several years. In Friday's blog post, the ODNI noted that the earlier reporting ""does not reflect the current status of FBI compliance."" The bureau itself was keen to stress how important its surveillance power was to keeping Americans safe. In a pair of letters to the leaders of the U.S. House and Senate - also released on Friday - FBI Director Chris Wray said that Section 702's ""critical importance to our national security has only grown."" He said it had helped thwart a Chinese effort to hack a ""major U.S. transportation hub"" in advance of a potential conflict over Taiwan and also frustrated Iranian hackers' attempts to target a former senior U.S. official under threat by Iranian agents. It was not clear whether the examples provided by the FBI were new. A senior bureau official declined to provide details during a call with reporters. In May, Microsoft (MSFT.O)warned of a group known as Volt Typhoon that was positioning itself to ""disrupt communications between the United States and Asia region during future crises."" Last year, an alleged Iranian agent was charged with trying to arrange the assassination of former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) dipped 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively, while Alphabet (GOOGL.O) added nearly 1% and Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) were near unchanged. Before trading begins on Monday, exchange operator Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) will trim the weight of a handful of companies that make up close to half of the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq describes the Nasdaq 100 as a ""modified market capitalization-weighted index,"" with company weights depending on their stock market value, while also applying rules to limit the influence of the largest stocks in the index. The Nasdaq 100 includes 100 of the largest companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange, and changes to the index will force investment funds that track it to adjust their portfolios and sell shares of companies that have their weight in the index reduced. ""We estimate that declining weights will drive passive net selling worth more than a day's average trading volume in GOOGL and more than one-third of a day's volume in MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA,"" Goldman Sachs wrote in a client note on Monday.

42,2023-07-24,0.9952,"2023-07-24Big Tech looks to turn the corner on cloud as AI focus stays strong|July 24 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giants could signal an end to the nearly year-long slowdown in their cloud businesses as signs of economic resilience encourage clients to boost technology spending, while a pickup in digital ads will also aid profits. Microsoft, Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon.com and Meta Platforms — companies that are together valued at over $6 trillion — are set to report earnings this week and the next, in what will be a test for their hefty valuations and the broader market rally they have driven thanks to optimism over artificial intelligence. ""We're really only looking for metrics that point to ramping user traction for AI-based offerings, with the idea being that they will generate more meaningful revenue in the medium-term,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane said. The four companies have this year aggressively integrated AI into their products on hopes that it would drive the industry's next growth cycle, but those efforts will take time to pay off. For Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) — the three biggest players in the cloud market — the April-June quarter is expected to mark another period of dismal growth in the business that has long been a cash cow. Both Amazon and Alphabet will likely report their lowest-ever growth for the cloud computing business at 9.8% and 24.4%, respectively, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv. Meanwhile Microsoft Intelligent Cloud, home to Azure, is expected to grow at 13.7%, the slowest rate since 2017. However, several analysts believe the trend is about to change. ""While the macro continues to be soft, it is not getting materially worse and companies are figuring out how to operate in this,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said. The current quarter will also have easier year-ago comparisons as the cloud slowdown started in the September quarter of 2022, Jaluria added. A recent survey by RBC Capital of more than 150 enterprise technology buyers showed that over four-fifth of them were funding projects related to generative AI and they broadly expect IT spending to increase this year over 2022. For Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O), revenue is expected to grow at its fastest pace in six quarters thanks to a pickup in the digital advertising market as consumer spending stays strong. ""If the digital ad space is like riding a roller coaster, we are just about done with the boring/tough part, slowly climbing to the top chain link by chain link,"" Bernstein analysts said. The digital ad market recovery will also aid Alphabet, whose Google Search has so far avoided any meaningful market share loss to Microsoft's AI-powered Bing. Alphabet is expected to report 4.5% revenue growth in the April-June period, its best in three quarters. ""Google Search has seemingly shifted from market share risk to monetization risk, but with search share seemingly healthy, Google may have less urgency to integrate LLM (large-language model) results into commercial queries,"" analysts at BofA Global Research said. Microsoft and Alphabet will report quarterly results on July 25, Meta on July 26 and Amazon on Aug. 3. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9952"
43,2023-07-24,0.9762,"2023-07-24Morning Bid: Euro biz ebbs, China property and rate peaks?|A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Another worrying drop in European business activity and a fresh property sector jolt in China encourages speculation the world's two most powerful central banks may end interest rate tightening campaigns this week with their final hikes of the cycle. In a week packed with market-moving events - G3 central bank decisions, mega-cap tech earnings, a Chinese Politburo meeting and second-quarter U.S. output numbers - the prospect of peak U.S. and euro zone interest rates will loom large. Futures markets assume the Federal Reserve's expected quarter-point hike to 5.25-5.50% on Wednesday will be its last of a 16-month squeeze, with less than a 50% chance of a further move later in the year priced. And money markets also see the European Central Bank's likely quarter point rate rise to 3.75% the following day as the last, again placing less than a 50-50 chance of another hike after that. The Bank of Japan is expected to hold the line on its super-easy money policy for now. Arguments for calling a halt to the credit tightening were strengthened on Monday as early July business surveys for the euro area came in well below forecasts, showing a deepening contraction in overall activity this month. The euro dropped more than half a percent against the dollar as euro government debt yields fell back, with an indecisive weekend election result in Spain adding pressure. With the ongoing slide in manufacturing still the biggest drag and due in large part to China's spluttering post-Covid recovery, further turbulence in China's property markets will only increase the anxiety. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index (.HSI), down more than 5% for the year so far, dropped another 2% on Monday and its index of mainland property developers (.HSMPI) plunged 6.4% - its second biggest daily drop of 2023. Debt repayment concerns at two of the country's biggest developers - Country Garden and Dalian Wanda - deepened a crisis of confidence in the sector. China's ruling Politburo met on Monday to shape its strategy for the year ahead and early local media readouts said it expects the economic recovery to be 'tortuous' requiring macro adjustments of a precise and forceful manner. Markets have worried that any stimulus to the flagging economy to date have largely been piecemeal moves. Hopes the BOJ stands pat on monetary policy helped Japan's Nikkei (.N225) outperform and it jumped more than 1%. For Wall St, the looming Fed decision dominates this week - with a check on U.S. July business surveys topping the data on Monday's calendar in another huge corporate earnings week. Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) report on Tuesday and Meta (META.O) is due out Wednesday, with massive 70%-plus share price gains so far this year for the mega cap tech vanguard index (.NYFANG) raising the bar and investors keen to hold AI-related excitement up to the light. Wall St's main stock indices ended marginally higher on Friday, with the Dow Jones bluechip index (.DJI) eking out its 10th consecutive daily gain for the first time in more than six years. Both S&P500 and Nasdaq futures pushed higher again on Monday, although the VIX volatility gauge (.VIX) popped to its highest in almost two weeks. U.S. Treasury yields fell back, but the dollar (.DXY) climbed against the euro, yuan and sterling - also hit by disappointing UK business readings for July. Events to watch for on Monday: * S&P Global July flash business surveys from the United States and around the world, Chicago Fed June business survey * U.S. corporate earnings: Whirlpool, Domino's Pizza, Brown & Brown, Alexandria Real Estate, NXP, Packaging Corp of America, F5, Cadence Design Systems * World Trade Organization general council meets in Geneva * U.S. Treasury auctions 2-year notes, 3- and 6-month bills Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9762"
44,2023-07-24,0.993,"2023-07-24Take Five: School's (not) out for summer|LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - The peak holiday season is gearing up, but school's not quite out for summer in financial markets. With the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan meeting, the first snapshot of July business activity, earnings and a Spanish election on the calendar, there's lots going on. Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Naomi Rovnick, Alun John and Dhara Ranasinghe in London. And just like that, the next Federal Reserve meeting is right around the corner. U.S. inflation is cooling but markets expect one more rate hike on July 26. The more interesting question is whether Chair Jerome Powell will signal the Fed is more confident inflation can cool further while growth stays resilient, meaning the most aggressive rate hiking cycle in decades is nearing an end. Signs that the Fed is unlikely to raise rates much further would, in theory, keep the wind in the sails of a buoyant Wall Street, while the dollar's tumble will likely continue. Also in focus are earnings from some of the massive tech and growth stocks that have led markets higher this year. Among them are Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), which report on July 25. Before they go on their summer break, ECB policymakers have a well-flagged rate hike to deliver. That will come on Thursday, with the key deposit rate tipped to rise a quarter point to 3.75%. ECB chief Christine Lagarde will no doubt be pressed for clarity on what happens in September, and economists are divided over whether there will be another rate increase or pause. Note, hawk Klaas Knot says any move beyond July is ""by no means a certainty"". Underlying inflation, a key focus for the ECB, remains high, but economic growth is weakening. The previously resilient services sector barely grew in June. The July PMI snapshot of business activity, out globally in coming days, should provide some further insights, as should the ECB's latest bank lending survey. Rate-setters' summer reading list just got longer. The Bank of Japan wants to promote communication with markets, but something may have been lost in translation. Comments from top rate-setters have tied investors in knots before a keenly anticipated two-day policy meeting starting on Thursday. Governor Kazuo Ueda's message of ""steady as she goes"" on stimulus, including yield curve control (YCC), was seen, by some, to have been undone by recent remarks by deputy Shinichi Uchida. Uchida says he ""strongly acknowledges"" YCC's negative impact, which hawks took as a hint of an imminent raising of the 0.5% ceiling for 10-year bond yields. Ueda then again backed continued easing in its current form and data on Friday showed inflation may have peaked. The benchmark yield has swung from 0.4% to a four-month high of 0.485% over the past two weeks, with the market dividing itself sharply into two camps. That creates plenty of opportunity for another jolting BOJ surprise. 4/ STOP: IT'S EARNINGS SEASON European quarterly earnings are starting to trickle in. The season will be a crucial one, with the STOXX 600 share index (.STOXX) up about 8% year to date. The rally has sputtered in July ahead of what Barclays describes as a ""make it or break it"" quarterly reporting season. Second-quarter earnings are expected to decrease 9.2% from a year earlier, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, with aggregate earnings likely to be weighed down by poor performance from energy companies. Stocks rallied earlier this year as investors, who were mostly bearish about Europe, switched their positions as global growth continued to defy expectations. That is a macroeconomic story rather than an earnings narrative, which makes European equities vulnerable to companies missing profit targets. A better than expected outcome, on the other hand, could fuel another bull run. No clear winner emerged in a nailbiting finish to Spain's election on Sunday, meaning political uncertainty could weigh on markets in the days ahead. The two leading parties - the conservative People's Party and the ruling Socialist Workers' Party - will seek to negotiate coalition deals in pursuit of a governing majority. But analysts warned the process could end in a hung parliament and another election. Also in focus is whether pressure on the main parties to cut taxes or increase spending worsens Spain's finances. High debt above 100% of GDP, a slowing economy and tighter EU fiscal rules coming into force in 2024 are concentrating minds. Stock-pickers are also keeping an eye on the energy sector, where the two main parties have different priorities, and financials, with the outlook for Spain's temporary banking levy in doubt.

45,2023-07-24,0.9229,"2023-07-24Morning Bid: Markets bide time as policymakers plot next moves|SYDNEY, July 24 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Stella Qiu It's a week that every investor has squarely on their radar: Three of the world's biggest central banks will deliver their latest policy moves and China's Politburo - its top policymaking body - is set to unveil support measures as the economy sputters. Meanwhile, markets seem to be biding their time. On Monday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was off a slight 0.3%, European stock futures were marginally lower and U.S. futures were flat. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HSI) was a bit of an outlier on the downside with a drop of 1.5%, dragged lower by Chinese property developers (.HSMPI) which tumbled more than 5%. With a quarter-point hike from both the Federal Reserve (on Wednesday) and the European Central Bank (on Thursday) looking set in stone, the focus will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde say about the rate outlook. If markets are right, this should be the last hike from the Fed and second-to-last from the ECB, as investors look ahead to the end of the great synchronised global tightening campaign - and rate cuts that may soon follow. , The U.S. earnings season will also move into higher gear this week with Meta Platforms (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) among the big names reporting. Their results will have to be good enough to justify the S&P 500's earning multiple of 20 times and its gains of 19% year-to-date. In Asia, contrary to what some investors were expecting, the Bank of Japan，which meets on Friday，is leaning towards keeping its yield control policy unchanged so that policymakers can scrutinise more data to ensure wages and inflation keep rising, sources told Reuters. That report sent the yen to a two-week low of 141.95 per dollar on Friday but the currency regained some composure in Asia as the new week began, steadying at 141.36 per dollar. Manufacturing activity in Japan extended declines in July while growth in the service sector slowed, surveys showed on Monday, a sign that global demand remains week and is weighing on Japanese businesses. For those looking for major stimulus from China's politburo meeting, which is expected to come on Friday, they risk disappointment again after months of anticipation. Piecemeal support measures from the government's various agencies in recent days to prop up the property sector and consumption have failed to impress. Beijing likes to do things on its own time and, after all, growth is still tracking in line with the government's economic target for the year of about 5%, although some big global banks have only recently cut their forecasts to come in line with that.

46,2023-07-23,0.9022,"2023-07-23Morning Bid: G3 central banks and China Politburo bonanza|July 24 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. The week ahead could be pivotal to the financial market landscape for the rest of the year, as the G3 central banks deliver their latest policy decisions and China's Politburo of the ruling Communist Party meets to discuss the economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan decisions and press conferences all come over the Wednesday-Friday 48-hour period, and China's Politburo is expected to begin its meet on Friday. If that wasn't enough, purchasing managers index figures will give the first indications on how economies performed in July. The U.S. earnings season moves up a gear with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet among the big names reporting. Dovish signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell would probably boost risk appetite and lift global stocks markets. The dollar and U.S. bond yields would likely come under downward pressure too - often bullish triggers for Asian and emerging markets. Investors in Asia have to wait until Friday for the big two set pieces of the week. More than three quarters of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to keep policy unchanged, including its yield control scheme. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his resolve to maintain massive monetary stimulus, despite inflation persistently outpacing the bank's 2% target. In a symbolic development last week, Japan's annual rate of headline consumer inflation rose above comparable U.S. inflation for the first time since 2015. But the BOJ's deflation battle scars run deep, so investor hopes of and end to super-loose policy are being pushed back further. It's a different story in China - the economy and markets are badly underperforming, growth forecasts are being slashed, and the big danger is deflation, not inflation. The central bank has been reluctant to ease policy because the already weak yuan could come under even greater selling pressure, so investors are pinning their hopes on a fiscal boost from Beijing. And it will have to be a significant boost. Measures announced on Friday to help boost sales of cars and electronics failed to impress investors, and foreigners are steering clear of China's financial assets even though they are relatively cheap. But the economic, financial, political and social challenges Beijing faces are such that Chinese stocks can get even cheaper before foreign investors start buying again en masse. Monday's economic data calendar and potential market-movers in Asia will be the Japanese and Australian PMIs, and the latest inflation figures from Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysian inflation is expected to fall to 2.4% in June - the lowest since April last year - from 2.8% in May. Singapore's inflation is seen falling to 4.55% - the lowest since February last year - from 5.10%.

47,2023-07-21,0.997,"2023-07-21OpenAI, Google, others pledge to watermark AI content for safety, White House says|WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) have made voluntary commitments to the White House to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to help make the technology safer, President Joe Biden announced on Friday. ""These commitments are a promising step but we have a lot more work to do together,"" Biden said. At a White House event, Biden addressed growing concerns about the potential for artificial intelligence to be used for disruptive purposes, saying ""we must be clear-eyed and vigilant about the threats from emerging technologies"" to U.S. democracy. The companies - which also include Anthropic, Inflection, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and OpenAI partner Microsoft (MSFT.O) - pledged to thoroughly test systems before releasing them and share information about how to reduce risks and invest in cybersecurity. The move is seen as a win for the Biden administration's effort to regulate the technology, which has experienced a boom in investment and consumer popularity. ""We welcome the president’s leadership in bringing the tech industry together to hammer out concrete steps that will help make AI safer, more secure, and more beneficial for the public,"" Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday. Since generative AI, which uses data to create new content like ChatGPT's human-sounding prose, became wildly popular this year, lawmakers around the world began considering how to mitigate the dangers of the emerging technology to national security and the economy. The U.S. lags the EU in tackling artificial intelligence regulation. In June, EU lawmakers agreed to a set of draft rules where systems like ChatGPT would have to disclose AI-generated content, help distinguish so-called deep-fake images from real ones and ensure safeguards against illegal content. U.S. Senate Majority Chuck Schumer in June called for ""comprehensive legislation"" to advance and ensure safeguards on artificial intelligence. Congress is considering a bill that would require political ads to disclose whether AI was used to create imagery or other content. Biden, who hosted executives from the seven companies at the White House on Friday, said he is also working on developing an executive order and bipartisan legislation on AI technology. ""We'll see more technology change in the next 10 years, or even in the next few years, than we've seen in the last 50 years. That has been an astounding revelation to me, quite frankly,"" Biden said. As part of the effort, the seven companies committed to developing a system to ""watermark"" all forms of content, from text, images, audios, to videos generated by AI so that users will know when the technology has been used. This watermark, embedded in the content in a technical manner, presumably will make it easier for users to spot deep-fake images or audios that may, for example, show violence that has not occurred, create a better scam or distort a photo of a politician to put the person in an unflattering light. It is unclear how the watermark will be evident in the sharing of the information. The companies also pledged to focus on protecting users' privacy as AI develops and on ensuring that the technology is free of bias and not used to discriminate against vulnerable groups. Other commitments include developing AI solutions to scientific problems like medical research and mitigating climate change. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Gold prices fell as the dollar rebounded to its highest in more than a week as investors prepare for next week's big central bank policy meetings, including the BOJ, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The yen weakened 1.16% to 141.74 per dollar, while the dollar index , a measure of the greenback against major trading currencies, rose 0.29%. The Dow eked out a gain to extend its winning streak to 10 sessions. But the Nasdaq fell and the S&P 500 barely rose, signs that the megacap tech and growth stocks that have driven the two indices respective 34% and 18% advances this year have stalled. Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston, said ""you've seen a broadening out in the rally coming off narrow leadership,"" a reference to megacaps such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc . More investors are now embracing the probability of a soft landing, with many companies well financed at lower interest rates so that higher rates - the Fed's terminal rate is expected to rise to 5.25%-5.5% next week - will not cause a credit crunch as in the past. ""This is an income-driven cycle as opposed to a credit cycle,"" said Melson. ""Real incomes are growing as inflation cools and corporate and household balance sheets are very, very robust and have excess cash,"" he said. ""Bottom line, the odds for a soft landing are very strong."" The Dow (.DJI) rose 0.01%, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) slid 0.22%. ""The mood across equity markets is unequivocally that the worst is behind us,"" said Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy and asset allocation at SLC Management in Boston, though the Fed's credit tightening is creating cracks. ""None of them are happening with massive severity, but the longer we go on with higher rates, more and more that's going to come through,"" he said. ""But again, big picture pretty good, but there are cracks."" A special rebalancing of the Nasdaq 100 (.NDX) that takes effect before Monday's opening may cause ""quirky price action"" in tech mega-caps, said Patrick Spencer, vice chair of equities at Baird in London. The overhaul of the index to reduce its heavy weightings of the super megacaps, such as Microsoft and Apple, may exacerbate moves in these stocks during the ongoing earnings season, he said. MSCI's U.S.-centric gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) closed down 0.2%, and the NYSE FANG+TM index (.NYFANG), which includes the megacap stocks, slid 0.97%. In Europe, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) rose 0.32% to end the week higher as declining tech stocks were offset by gains in energy companies that tracked oil prices higher. BOJ policymakers prefer to scrutinize more data to ensure wages and inflation keep rising before changing yield control policy, five sources familiar with the matter said. The report added there was no consensus within the central bank and the decision could still be a close call. As Japanese inflation has stayed above the BOJ's target, traders have bet on the central bank ditching its yield curve control program, a move likely to cause the yen to strengthen. ""Markets were building up expectations which now look unlikely to play out,"" said Guillaume Paillat, a multi-asset manager at Aviva Investors. Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield fell 5 bps to 0.41%, the lowest level since July 6, right before speculation for a hawkish tweak to policy this month began to ramp up. The bond posted its biggest one-day fall since April. In U.S. bond markets, Treasury yields mostly eased after spending Thursday braced for further Fed hawkishness in response to an unexpected drop in weekly unemployment claims. The two-year Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 0.7 basis points at 4.846%, while the benchmark 10-year yield fell 1.7 basis points to 3.837%. Oil prices edged higher, buoyed by evidence of tightening supplies and economic stimulus in slow-recovering China. U.S. crude rose $1.42 to settle at $77.07 a barrel and Brent settled up $1.43 at $81.07. U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower at $1,966.60 an ounce.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) set out on Friday Microsoft's arguments for the reconsideration, as the U.S. battles to win UK approval to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision. Having initially blocked the $69 billion deal in April over concerns about its impact on competition in the cloud gaming market, the CMA has since reopened the file, after it was left increasingly isolated amongst world regulators in its opposition. The CMA said it is likely to be able to reach a new provisional view on the restructured deal in the week beginning Aug. 7. Explaining why the deal should now be given the green light, Microsoft argued that the binding commitments accepted by the European Union shortly after Britain had blocked the deal changed matters, court documents published showed. The software company gave legally-binding commitments to European authorities that Activision games can be streamed for a decade after the merger, and has entered into agreements with NVIDIA, Boosteroid and Ubitus. As part of that a monitoring and enforcement regime will be established, which Microsoft said should ease some of the CMA's concerns. Microsoft also argued that the terms of the CMA’s proposed block reached further than necessary to tackle its cloud gaming concerns, for example in covering Activision Blizzard’s King unit, which makes mobile device games like Candy Crush Saga. The CMA said it understood that Microsoft considered the recent licensing deal it agreed with Sony constituted a further material change of circumstance or special reason. For its part, the CMA dismissed as ""irrelevant and immaterial"" to its decision to look again at the deal the failure by U.S. authorities to get it blocked in the courts there. Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal provisionally approved the adjournment on Monday subject to further submissions from the parties. It formally granted it on Friday.

Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati will directly manage the team on an interim basis, and Willner will continue to advise through the end of the year, OpenAI said in a statement. Trust and safety departments have taken on a high-profile role in technology companies such as OpenAI, Twitter , Alphabet and Meta (META.O) as they seek to limit the spread of hate speech, misinformation and other harmful content on their platforms.

""Anyone with young children and a super intense job can relate to that tension, I think, and these past few months have really crystallised for me that I was going to have to prioritise one or the other,"" he said in the post. ""I've moved teaching the kids to swim and ride their bikes to the top of my OKRs (objectives and key results) this summer."" Microsoft-backed OpenAI, whose AI chatbot ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer application in history earlier this year, has said it depends on its trust and safety team to build ""the processes and capabilities to prevent misuse and abuse of AI technologies"".
