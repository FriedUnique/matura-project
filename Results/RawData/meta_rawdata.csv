Last month, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) said it would take legal action against Meta for failing to act against ""undesirable"" content relating to race, royalty, religion, defamation, impersonation, online gambling, and scam advertisements. Fahmi said Meta had since given a firm commitment to work with Malaysian authorities, including the regulator and the police, to tackle such posts on its platforms. ""I don't think MCMC needs at this point in time to initiate any legal action. I think this level of cooperation is very positive,"" he said, adding that the government was considering measures such as fines against social media platforms if they failed to tackle harmful content. Facebook is Malaysia's biggest social media platform, with an estimated 60% of the country's 33 million people having a registered account. Fahmi dismissed concerns raised over increased government scrutiny of online content, and denied issuing orders to take down several opposition-linked news sites and social media accounts in recent weeks. The take-downs, he said, were likely to have been made in response to complaints made by ordinary users for violating social media guidelines. The outages came as Malaysia prepares to hold regional elections next month that will pit Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration against a conversative Malay-Muslim alliance. The government did not intend to curb freedom of expression, but drew the line at content touching on race, religion, and royalty, Fahmi said. ""Those who cry out, saying that we are an iron-fisted dictatorship, I think they’re being a tad bit dramatic,"" he said. Race and religion are thorny issues in Malaysia, which has a majority of mainly Muslim ethnic Malays alongside significant Chinese and Indian minorities. Malaysia also has laws prohibiting insults against its sultans, who play a largely ceremonial role. An opposition figure was charged this month with sedition for allegedly insulting them. Separately, Fahmi said Malaysia's major telecommunications firms will form the country's second 5G network, as part of the government's plan to end a monopoly held by state-owned 5G agency Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB). The firms, which have agreed to take up stakes in DNB and use its network, will split to form the second 5G entity when coverage reaches 80% of populated areas, Fahmi said.

Retention of users on the text-based app was better than executives had expected, though it was ""not perfect,"" said Zuckerberg, speaking at an internal company town hall, the audio of which was heard by Reuters. ""Obviously, if you have more than 100 million people sign up, ideally it would be awesome if all of them or even half of them stuck around. We're not there yet,"" he said. Zuckerberg said he considered the drop-off ""normal"" and expected retention to grow as the company adds more features to the app, including a desktop version and search functionality. Meta is looking at adding more ""retention-driving hooks"" to entice users to return to the app, like ""making sure people who are on the Instagram app can see important Threads,"" said Chief Product Officer Chris Cox. A company spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting. The executives' comments came a day after Meta wowed investors with a rosy revenue growth forecast, a sign of a comeback for a company that faced deep skepticism over its hefty spending on the metaverse last year as ad sales plummeted. The disclosure sent Meta's shares surging 8% on Thursday. Zuckerberg told employees on the call that he believed the company's work on the augmented and virtual reality technology that would power the metaverse was ""not massively ahead of schedule, but on track."" Meta, he added, needed to get started investing in that work ahead of rivals such as Apple (AAPL.O), Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O), given their years of experience building operating systems for existing products. ""That way, we have all the tools ready for when this is ready for prime time,"" he said, predicting that mass adoption of metaverse technologies would take place in the 2030s. Zuckerberg and Cox also highlighted the company's release of an artificial intelligence model called Llama 2 this month, which it made freely available for commercial use to any developer whose services had fewer than 700 million users. The model has received more than 150,000 download requests in the week since its release, Cox said. Responding to a question on the proposed ""cage match"" against Elon Musk, Zuckerberg said he was ""not sure if it's going to come together.""

2,2023-07-28,0.9963,"2023-07-28Dow Jones index set to end 13 day winning streak|July 27 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was on the verge of ending its longest winning streak in 36 years on Thursday, successive gains showing that Wall Street's tech-driven rally is broadening to include a wider chunk of the stock market. The Dow closed higher for 13 straight sessions through Wednesday, its longest series of positive closes since 1987, and was last down 0.5% on Thursday afternoon after gaining earlier in the session. While the S&P 500 (.SPX), which includes over 500 stocks, is many investment professionals' preferred stock market benchmark, the Dow's daily moves are widely quoted in news media, making it widely recognized by many Americans. Its recent rally comes as traders widely believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday was the last in its campaign to control inflation. Investors are also optimistic the U.S. economy will avoid a recession. The Dow's longest-ever winning streak was 14 sessions, set in 1897, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Even after its recent gains, the Dow has lagged Wall Street's other main indexes in 2023. It is up 7% year to date, compared to a 18% gain in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq's (.IXIC) 35% surge. ""The Dow has been the laggard of the big three, and now it seems to be playing catch up. I think that catch-up trade is bringing us to a healthier place,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. The Dow's 30 constituents do not include market heavyweights Tesla (TSLA.O), Meta Platforms (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) or Amazon (AMZN.O), major winners in a stock market rally this year fueled by optimism about artificial intelligence and an eventual end to the Fed's rate hikes. ""We are actually seeing the market broaden out, so it's not just about seven artificial intelligence anointed darlings,"" Hogan added. Dow components Salesforce (CRM.N), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have rallied between 40% and 70% this year, making them the Dow's top performers. But the Dow has also been held back by declines of 10% or more in Amgen (AMGN.O), Chevron (CVX.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA.O). Overall, nearly half of Dow constituents remain down in 2023, even after outperforming so far in July. While the Dow's recent winning streak is unusually long, its overall strength has not been exceptional. The index climbed 4.8% since July 7, compared to 3.1% increase in the Nasdaq and a 3.4% rise in the S&P 500. The Dow's last 13-day winning streak in January 1987 produced a gain of 11.1%.

The Nikkei newspaper reported the central bank will maintain its 0.5% cap for the 10-year government bond yield, but discuss allowing long-term interest rates to rise above that level by a certain degree. Reuters confirmed the central bank may make minor tweaks to extend the lifespan of its yield control policy. Michael Green, chief investment strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said reports of the Bank of Japan's plans were the biggest driver behind Wall Street's performance on Thursday. Higher rates in Japan pushed the U.S. 10-year yield over 4% and reduced the attractiveness of stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 237.4 points, or 0.67%, to 35,282.72, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 29.29 points, or 0.64%, to 4,537.46 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 77.18 points, or 0.55%, to 14,050.11. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points as expected. Traders now only see a 20% chance that the Fed could surprise with a quarter-point increase in September. FEDWATCH Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that Fed staff are no longer forecasting a U.S. recession, but did not rule out another rate hike, saying the Fed would follow future economic data. On Thursday, a Commerce Department report showed the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the latest quarter, with an advance gross domestic product reading of 2.4%, above the 1.8% forecast by economists polled by Reuters. Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco, said the strong economic data earlier in the day also made the market reassess its positioning after the Federal Reserve slightly upgraded its growth outlook on Wednesday. ""The markets are looking at the increased potential for another Fed rate hike that had largely been priced out. Now it's being priced back in,"" said Rupert, who expects a Fed rate hike in September. Meta (META.O) gained 4.40% after it reported a jump in second-quarter advertising revenue, topping Wall Street financial targets. Microsoft, which on Tuesday surpassed estimates for quarterly revenue and profit, closed down 2.09%, as it laid out an aggressive spending plan to meet demand for its new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered services. Outsized gains in megacap growth stocks have helped the Nasdaq (.IXIC) lead the charge on Wall Street so far this year, with the index rising about 34%. EBay (EBAY.O) forecast third-quarter profit below market expectations as the e-commerce platform spent more to bolster categories such as auto parts, refurbished goods and collectibles, sending its shares down 10.53%. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Micron (MU.O) rose 0.99% and 5.48% respectively after Lam Research (LRCX.O) forecast upbeat quarterly sales. Shares of Lam also advanced. Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) tumbled 8.94% after the airline posted a dip in second-quarter profit, while Royal Caribbean (RCL.N) surged after the cruise operator lifted its annual profit forecast. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank raised interest rates for the ninth consecutive time and kept the door open to further tightening. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9955"
4,2023-07-27,0.9877,"2023-07-27Roku shares surge as better ad spending powers upbeat revenue forecast|July 27 (Reuters) - Roku (ROKU.O) forecast upbeat third-quarter revenue and posted market-beating results for the second quarter on improved ad sales, sending the shares of the streaming device maker up 9% after the bell. After several months of muted spending, companies are raising their expenditure on ads on signs of cooling inflation and improving consumer sentiment. ""We have begun to see some ad verticals improve, which resulted in modest YoY platform revenue growth in Q2, and we are well positioned to re-accelerate growth as the ad market recovers,"" company executives said in a letter to shareholders. Roku expects $815 million in net revenue in the July-September period, higher than analysts' projection of $809.6 million, according to Refinitiv data. Chief Financial Officer Dan Jedda said the pickup in ad spending is coming from the consumer products, and health and wellness industries, while tech, media and entertainment remains challenged. Roku's strong guidance comes after large digital platforms Meta Platforms (META.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) delivered upbeat results on higher digital ad sales. ""In addition to capturing advertising dollars shifting from traditional linear distribution to over-the-top, Roku has made progress in clawing away spend from other digital channels,"" said Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley. Roku, which offers streaming devices and also has its own ad-supported channel, posted better-than-expected results for the quarter ended June. Net revenue grew 11% to $847.2 million, above estimates of $774.5 million, while adjusted loss came in at 76 cents per share, lower than the estimate of $1.26. The company said it added 1.9 million ""active accounts"" from the previous quarter to 73.5 million. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9877"
5,2023-07-27,0.9948,"2023-07-27Meta's Reels revenue narrows in on TikTok, boosted by AI|July 27 (Reuters) - Reels, Meta Platforms' (META.O) answer to viral short-form video app TikTok, elicited eyerolls when it launched in 2020 and was regarded as yet another example of Meta copying a popular rival. But on Wednesday, Meta revealed numbers that show Reels videos are growing rapidly among both users and advertisers and are quickly catching up to the ByteDance-owned TikTok app that is beloved by young users and has reshaped the social media landscape. Meta says the rags-to-riches growth of Reels, which are viewable on both Facebook and Instagram, speaks in part to the company's improving recommendation software, long the Chinese-owned rival's strong point. ""We can show Reels that we think you're interested in based on our discovery engines,"" Justin Osofsky, Meta's head of online sales, operations and partnerships, said in an interview on Thursday. The number of Reels video plays on Facebook and Instagram now top 200 billion per day, up from 140 billion last fall. TikTok did not respond immediately to a request to provide its daily figures. The growth of Reels ""creates a base that you have the opportunity to further monetize,"" Osofsky said. Though Meta has invested in artificial intelligence for years, it is now moving to the forefront of its business to improve content recommendations and ads across the company's services, he added. Reels' annual revenue run rate has jumped to $10 billion, up from around $3 billion as of last fall and $1 billion last summer, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a conference call with analysts following its second quarter results. That means Reels is about the size of TikTok's business as of last year, when it pulled in $9.9 billion in worldwide ad revenue, according to estimates from research firm Insider Intelligence, which forecast $13.2 billion in global ad revenue this year. One reason for Reels' growth is that Meta's ad platform makes it seamless for advertisers to place their promotions on the feature, said Debra Aho Williamson, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. ""It's as easy as checking a box,"" she said. More than three-quarters of Meta's advertisers are placing ads on Reels, said Susan Li, Meta's chief financial officer. Throughout 2022, Meta executives fielded questions from investors about whether fast-growing Reels consumption was actually hurting ad sales by taking users' time away from higher-earning areas of its apps, like the News Feed. There were relatively few ads in Reels at that point, but Zuckerberg said he expected advertisers to embrace the format over time, as they had with previous transitions from desktop to mobile and from Feed to Stories, Meta's Snapchat-like format. On the earnings call on Wednesday, Li said the company expected Reels would continue earning less money than the ads Meta generates from its Stories and Feed features, ""since people scroll more slowly through video content."" TikTok and its famous content recommendation algorithm remains the leader when it comes to time spent on social media apps. The average U.S. user spends 53.8 minutes per day on TikTok, versus 48.7 minutes on YouTube, 33.1 minutes on Instagram and 30.9 minutes on Facebook, according to Insider Intelligence estimates.

6,2023-07-27,0.9709,"2023-07-27US senators Warren, Graham kick off bipartisan anti-Big Tech push|WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said on Thursday they would push for an ambitious bill to create a new government regulator empowered to rein in Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook, Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and other Big Tech platforms. For several years, bills intended to clip the wings of Big Tech companies have fallen short in U.S. Congress even as federal agencies wage legal battles against Google and Facebook over alleged violations of antitrust law. In addition to creating the regulatory commission, the proposed law would tighten antitrust law to forbid the companies from preferencing their own products over those of rivals. Amazon, for example, has been accused of favoring its own brands when consumers conduct searches on Amazon. It would allow the commission to stop certain acquisitions by the companies and force asset sales in some circumstances, Warren's office said in a description of the proposed measure. The measure would also guarantee some privacy protections and limit foreign ownership and access to data by foreign adversaries. Like the Federal Trade Commission, the new Digital Consumer Protection Commission would have five commissioners with a maximum of three from one political party. ""This bipartisan bill would create a new tech regulator and makes clear that reining in Big Tech platforms is a top priority on both sides of the aisle,"" said Warren in a statement. Graham said the creation of the regulatory commission was ""the first step in a long journey to protect American consumers from the massive power these companies currently wield.""

7,2023-07-27,0.9956,"2023-07-27Facebook parent Meta sees advertising jump, tops Wall Street targets|July 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) on Wednesday reported a strong rise in advertising revenue, topping Wall Street financial targets for the second quarter and forecasting third-quarter revenue above market expectations. The results from Meta, Facebook's parent company, come a day after a strong performance from Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and make the case that consumers, and the advertisers eager to reach them, are spending despite broad economic concerns. Still, the company also forecast that expenses would rise in both 2023 and 2024, citing costs including legal fees and increased spending on infrastructure considered key to the tech sector's feverish AI race. That spending comes after aggressive cost-cutting in other parts of the company, including safety teams and basic business functions. Meta shares were up 7.5% in after-hours trade. ""We continue to see strong engagement across our apps and we have the most exciting roadmap I've seen in a while with Llama 2, Threads, Reels, new AI products in the pipeline, and the launch of Quest 3 this fall,"" Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said. Meta's second-quarter revenue grew 11% to $32 billion in the quarter ended June 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of $31.12 billion. Ad revenue rose 12% in the quarter, faster than growth at Google, where ad revenue rose 3%. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.98 topped Wall Street targets of $2.91, according to data from Refinitiv. The social media giant has been climbing back from a bruising 2022, buoyed by hype around emerging AI technology and an austerity drive in which it has shed around 21,000 employees since last fall. The company's shares have more than doubled in value this year as a result. Advertisers are reinforcing those gains by pumping money into digital ads again after months of muted spending, heartened by signs that the economy may overcome a bout of high inflation without suffering a major meltdown. Brands are hedging their bets, however, and sticking with tried and true platforms. That helps Meta and Alphabet while punishing smaller players like Snap (SNAP.N), which reported disappointing sales on Tuesday. Meta's revenue forecast did not specify whether the figure includes any sales that might come from the recently launched Threads app, which does not yet have ads. The revenue gains provide relief as Meta makes massive investments to upgrade its data centers and stay competitive in an emerging arms race around AI technology, while continuing to invest more than $10 billion a year in a longer-term bet on ""metaverse"" hardware and software. Meta cut its capital expenditure forecast for 2023, driven in part by pushing some costs related to artificial intelligence into 2024, when capex is expected to grow. Zuckerberg told investors that executives were ""debating heavily"" how much AI capacity to bring online to prepare for a potential explosion in need. He saw three product categories for AI: features for advertisers, AI agents on chat and internal company productivity tools. He said he envisioned some revenue coming from Meta's recently released Llama 2 model, which is largely open source but requires a license for use by companies with more than 700 million users. ""We want this to be open. But if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to basically be reselling these services, that's something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for,"" Zuckerberg said. Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is responsible for developing metaverse-oriented technology like augmented reality glasses, reported sales of $276 million, down from $452 million in the same quarter last year. The unit lost $3.7 billion in the second quarter, putting it on track to have far higher costs than the $5 billion annual target set out in a widely circulated investor note in the fall. The unit has lost more than $40 billion since 2021, including $13.7 billion last year. Meta said it expected Reality Labs operating losses to ""increase meaningfully"" in 2024 as the company continued to invest in augmented and virtual reality and ""scale our ecosystem."" Zuckerberg had previously said Meta would ""pace"" investments in the division after 2023. He told investors he understood why many of them would feel discomfort over such a long-term bet. The company expects 2023 total expenses in the range of $88 billion to $91 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $86 billion to $90 billion, citing ""legal-related expenses."" Meta said second-quarter expenses included legal costs of $1.87 billion, mostly related to a fine by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner in May for transferring user information to the United States. The fine itself was 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion). It said it expected ""higher infrastructure-related costs"" in 2024, as well as growth in payroll expenses ""as we evolve our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.""

8,2023-07-27,0.9959,"2023-07-27Meta rallies as AI-powered ad sales drive 'monster' forecast|July 27 (Reuters) - Meta (META.O) shares surged nearly 8% on Thursday as a rosy revenue forecast showed that artificial intelligence was helping the social media giant boost engagement and ad sales even in an uncertain economy. The Facebook owner was set to add about $60 billion to its market value after strong second-quarter earnings encouraged 18 analysts to lift their target price on a stock that has already more than doubled this year. ""Meta (is) in a class-of-their-own in digital ads,"" said Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, adding that its ""monster guidance blew the doors off with an expected growth rate of +15-24% — numbers investors were hoping to maybe see as early as Q4."" While Meta's 12% rise in second-quarter ad revenue surpassed the 3% growth at Alphabet's Google, earnings reports from both the digital ad behemoths reinforced a recovery in the sector. Meta and Google are on track to add around $160 billion to their combined market capitalization - a figure that is more than the individual market values of about 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 index. Smaller rival Snap (SNAP.N), however, disappointed on ad sales as advertisers stick to tried and true platforms. Meta's results were also supported by improving monetization of Reels, a short-form video format that is the company's answer to TikTok. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Reels now has an annual revenue run rate exceeding $10 billion, up from $3 billion last fall. ""Advertisers are gaining confidence in Meta's enhanced and AI-powered campaign planning and measurement capabilities, and spending more. Unsurprisingly, Reels monetization keeps improving,"" said Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi. The positive analyst view reinforces how a focus on cost cuts and higher engagement through AI has helped Meta turn into a Wall Street darling this year after being derided for much of 2022 for its hefty spending on the ambitious metaverse. Analysts have a median price target of $355.50 on Meta, which represents an upside of 19% to its stock's last close. The company has 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.28, higher than Alphabet's 20.47 and the industry median of 15.18. The accelerating revenue growth at Meta helped allay some concerns about an expected jump in expenses in 2024 due to legal fees and increased spending on infrastructure considered key to the tech sector's feverish AI race. ""There is an element of uncertainty in CapEx spending growth for 2024. That said, we do also see a series of monetization opportunities that can be sprung out of these innovations,"" said Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell remained equivocal about whether there was one more policy rate rise left this year and said Fed staff were no longer forecasting a recession - but futures markets continue to see a less than 50% chance of another move. Treasury yields and the dollar (.DXY) eased overnight. The Commerce Department's snapshot of gross domestic product due on Thursday is expected to show the U.S. economy grew at a trend rate of 1.8% in second-quarter, almost a full point drop in core inflation to 4% and the housing slump nearing an end. The stock market remains buoyed near highs for the year. Aided by upbeat Boeing results, the Dow Jones blue chip index (.DJI) clocked 13 straight daily gains on Wednesday for the first time since 1987 and S&P500 futures are up again ahead of today's bell. The VIX (.VIX) volatility gauge slipped below 13 for the first time this month. But Meta Platforms (META.O) stole the show overnight, with its stock soaring 7% after the digital giant reported a strong rise in advertising revenue - while topping Wall Street financial targets and third-quarter revenue guidance. Global stocks (.MIWD00000PUS) hit their highest since April last year on Thursday, with European stocks up more than 1% ahead of the ECB decision. While the ECB is also expected to deliver a quarter-point hike to 3.75%, money markets similarly doubt there's another rate rise left in the campaign - wary of a euro zone economy that's slipping in and out of recession this year as disinflation progresses. The euro pushed higher against a softer dollar ahead of the announcement and press conference from ECB chief Christine Lagarde. The yen also firmed as the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its easy policy unchanged on Friday. The rest of the news was dominated by the screed of earnings hitting the headlines. Shares in oil giants Shell (SHEL.L) and TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) fell after they both missed forecasts in reporting big profit drops for the second quarter - the result of the sharp oil price recoil over the last year. Barclays (BARC.L) was again an outlier in banking. Its shares dived 7% despite plans for a hefty buyback after the British lender warned of growing pressure on its UK business and missed forecasts for its investment bank as a global corporate dealmaking slump persists. The euro zone's biggest bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), by contrast, beat Q2 estimates and the stock jumped 4%. In Asia, Hong Kong shares (.HSI) rose in line with world markets, but mainland China indices continue to stumble under a cloud.

The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by a widely expected 25 basis points, marking the 11th hike in the U.S. central bank's past 12 policy meetings. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference the central bank will make decisions meeting by meeting, closely watching economic data, but noted that a rate cut is very unlikely this year. Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients that the Fed's statement did not signal a slower pace of hikes in the future, but that the bank was expecting a hold in September. ""The message for the market was that it didn't move the needle. There's always a fear of a big surprise,"" said Angelo Kourfafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones. Powell's message was clearly that the Fed will wait and see economic data to make new decisions, said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. ""I think the Fed won't stop until they see wage inflation down."" Following long-awaited earnings on Tuesday, big tech companies' shares had mixed reactions. Microsoft (MSFT.O) eased 3.72% after laying out an aggressive spending plan to meet demand for its new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered services. The Windows maker still surpassed estimates for quarterly revenue and profit. Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.78% after the Google parent's second-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street expectations on steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising. The NYSE FANG+ index (.NYFANG), which houses many megacap growth names, dropped 0.72%. The index has rallied roughly 75% so far this year on optimism over AI and hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle.

11,2023-07-26,0.9795,"2023-07-26Morning Bid: China realism returns, Powell has spoken|July 27 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. A sense of cautious optimism could be the tone across Asia early on Thursday as China's markets cool down, investors welcome fairly balanced comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and await the European Central Bank's rate decision. After a volatile start to markets this week, the concentration of major 'event risk' - the Fed and ECB meetings, the Bank of Japan's policy decision on Friday and potential details on China's stimulus measures - may be keeping investors from taking big bets. That said, some big earnings reports from some of the biggest U.S. tech firms continue to roll in, meaning there could be big price swings in individual stocks and sectors under the hood of the broader indices. This was in evidence on Wednesday on Wall Street. The Nasdaq fell only 0.1% and 'big tech' fell less than 1% but that masked huge moves in some shares which added or wiped out tens of billions of dollars of market cap. Microsoft fell 4%, Snap plunged 15%, while Alphabet surged 5.5%. Shares in Meta jumped 7% in after hours trade after the Facebook owner reported stronger-than-expected Q2 revenues and forecast strong Q3 revenues. Investors in Asia will also wake up to the 11th U.S. interest rate hike since the Fed began hiking rates last year - and the highest rates in 22 years - and a fairly balanced policy outlook for the coming months from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He left the door open to further tightening but also said the Fed could stay on hold if the data warranted and stressed that decisions will be made on a meeting by meeting basis. His measured remarks helped ensure a fairly subdued day on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrials rose 0.24%, insignificant in itself but at the same time historic - it was the 13th consecutive daily rise, the index's longest winning streak since January 1987. Few would have imagined then that the market's biggest ever fall - the 22% crash on Black Monday - was only nine months away. Back in Asia, a sense of realism returned over the expected measures from Beijing to revitalize the economy. After outsized gains on Tuesday - a 14% surge in property stocks - major indices in China and Hong Kong closed in the red. The main event on Thursday's economic calendar is Chinese industrial profits for June, which could underline how weak the economy has been since Covid restrictions were lifted. Profits have been falling every month for a year, registering double-digit declines every month so far this year. They slumped 18.8% in May. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday: - China industrial profits (June) - Australia import and export prices (Q2) - European Central Bank policy decision Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

12,2023-07-26,-0.9612,"2023-07-26Apple, Meta, Google argue they're not 'bookies' in casino app appeal|(Reuters) - Apple, Meta and Google warned the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals this week that if online platforms can be held liable for processing users’ purchases of virtual chips sold by casino game apps, the entire internet economy could be at risk. The platforms are appealing a 2022 ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Davila of San Jose, California, that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which immunizes online publishers for hosting third-party content, does not shield the sites from claims that they essentially acted as “bookies” by facilitating (and collecting a commission on) purchases of virtual chips for use in online casino games. The trial judge said that those payment processing claims, asserted in more than a dozen statewide class actions on behalf of casino app users from states with stringent gambling laws, fall outside of Section 230’s immunity for online publishers because they involved allegedly unlawful acts by the platforms themselves. Davila did dismiss plaintiffs' claims that Apple (AAPL.O) , Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Meta (META.O) were liable for offering access to the casino apps and providing the app developers with data and other services to help them target big spenders and retain users. The judge, as I told you last year, acknowledged that “reasonable minds” might reach different conclusions about the scope of the platforms' immunity under Section 230 in the context of casino apps. The judge, of his own accord, certified his order for interlocutory appeal. Both sides took him up on that offer. Apple, Meta and Google appealed Davila’s decision that they can be liable for processing virtual chip payments. Plaintiffs' lawyers from law firm Edelson brought cross-appeals over their dismissed claims. The platforms’ newly filed briefs are the first salvos in an appellate briefing process that won’t wrap up until December. Apple, Meta and Google each filed its own brief, so the appeals are not identical. (Google, for instance, opted not to use the word ""bookie."") But all of the filings assert the same basic arguments: Davila wrongly interpreted 9th Circuit precedent from HomeAway.com Inc v. City of Santa Monica – and unless the 9th Circuit overturns his decision, the consequences could be dire. At worst, the platforms said, every website that offers in-app purchases – including sites like Spotify and Substack, which sell subscriptions – could be exposed to liability whenever a plaintiff claims an injury from an unlawful product. Apple’s lawyers at Weil, Gotshal & Manges said the theory proffered by the casino apps plaintiffs for circumventing Section 230 immunity is ""limitless."" Meta counsel from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe echoed that argument, warning the 9th Circuit that “clever lawyers” will find ways to use Davila’s reasoning to recast claims that would be precluded under Section 230. “Plaintiffs’ wordplay of isolating the transaction from the content itself would offer an easy end-run around this court’s existing decisions applying Section 230, none of which makes protection turn on whether the service received compensation in connection with the purchase of challenged third-party content,” Meta said. The platforms argued that because different countries, states and geographical regions have different laws, Davila’s reasoning would force them to engage in intensive monitoring of apps and individual users to avert claims that they facilitated illegal conduct by processing payments. Platforms would even need to check on users’ geographic location as they interacted with particular apps, Apple said. “That goes far beyond monitoring,” the Apple brief asserted. “That would be Orwellian.” It's also not what Congress intended when it passed Section 230 to protect online publishers, the platforms said. Davila’s mistake, they argued, was in failing to treat the platforms as publishers when they processed casino app users' payments for virtual casino chips. The platforms, explained Google's lawyers at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, did not create the chips sold by the allegedly illegal casino apps. Nor did they create the apps that encourage users to buy the virtual chips. Google merely offered the casino apps the same payment processing services its provides as a publisher, the brief said, so it’s impossible to divorce payment processing from the hosting activity Davila found to be immunized under Section 230. That distinguishes the online gambling case from the conduct at issue in the HomeAway case that Davila relied upon, according to the platforms. The 9th Circuit ruled in that case that Section 230 did not pre-empt a Santa Monica law barring websites from accepting booking fees for certain short-term housing rentals. The sites had argued that the city law would contravene Section 230 by requiring them to monitor online content to be sure they did not offer illegal rentals. The 9th Circuit rejected that contention, concluding that the prohibition addressed the booking, not the online listings. In the casino app cases, argued Apple, Meta and Google in their 9th Circuit briefs, the platforms have no independent duty, outside of their role as a publisher, to refuse to process in-app payments. Their purportedly illegal conduct, they said, is based entirely on the nature of the casino apps and the virtual chips they sell – a critical difference between HomeAway and the casino cases. “In HomeAway, the claims did not turn at all on the nature of the third-party content (the online rental listings); whereas here, the claims turn entirely on the nature of the casino-themed video games and virtual chips,” Meta asserted. “That distinction is dispositive under Section 230.” I reached out to plaintiffs' lawyers Rafey Balabanian and Jay Edelson of Edelson for comment on the platforms’ brief. They didn’t respond. Edelson has collected hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements with casino app developers, including a $415 million class settlement approved in June. Apple, Meta, Google and their lawyers also did not respond to queries. As I mentioned, there will be a lot more action to come in these appeals and counterappeals at the 9th Circuit. But this week’s initial foray proves, if you will excuse the pun, that the stakes in these casino app cases are sky-high.

13,2023-07-26,0.3818,"2023-07-26Snap’s boss destroys $43 billion in a snap|NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Snap’s (SNAP.N) value is disappearing almost as quickly as its messages. The $16 billion social media company said on Tuesday that revenue declined in the second quarter, wiping almost a fifth off its market capitalization. Since its initial public offering in 2017, shares have declined 13% on average, annually. It might be time to rethink Snap’s future. Too bad for shareholders, boss Evan Spiegel has almost complete control. Snap is still struggling to pry money from advertisers, a worrisome trend for a relatively young company. Revenue for the second quarter fell 4% year-over-year to $1 billion and the outlook for third quarter is not much of an improvement. The top line is expected to be flat at best and decline 5% at worst, the company said. It wasn’t always this way – and it doesn’t have to continue. Snap had for a while managed to far outpace Meta Platforms’(META.O) revenue growth, having quadrupled its top line since the end of 2018 through 2022, while sales at Mark Zuckerberg’s $755 billion giant, which reports earnings Wednesday night, have about doubled. The problem is that Spiegel hasn’t yet figured out a viable business model, and that’s become a much bigger problem in a more competitive advertising market. For example, daily active users jumped 14% this quarter to 397 million, notching 18 consecutive quarters of growth. There’s no reason Spiegel can’t deliver. Spiegel might chalk the company’s valuation degradation up to a more measured stock market, and there’s something to that. When the then 26-year-old co-founder brought Snap public, the company, whose deal was 10 times oversubscribed, had promises of being the next Facebook. The same year companies like online food delivery startup Blue Apron (APRN.N) were getting a huge reception. That was bound to – and has – subsided. The trouble is that Snap failed to return even the bare minimum. Take its IPO price of $17 a share and assume that equity investors expect a return of around 15% a year, slightly higher than Meta’s 13% over the same period. Snap’s shares should be worth some $37, or $60 billion overall. The California-based company needs a new blueprint, and a sale might be in the cards. The trouble is Spiegel controls it through voting shares and has since it went public. Snap shareholders can’t wail if they are ghosted. (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.) Follow @jennifersaba on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS Snap said on July 25 that second-quarter revenue fell 4% year-over-year to $1 billion.

14,2023-07-26,0.992,"2023-07-26Big Tech under pressure as Microsoft results put AI costs in spotlight|July 26 (Reuters) - A number of U.S. big tech companies fell on Wednesday as Microsoft's results signaled how the high-stakes battle for AI supremacy will cost the tech giants that have seen their shares rally in recent months on hype around the technology. Microsoft's (MSFT.O) shares fell 3.6% in early trading as the company laid out an aggressive AI-related spending plan, saying deeper investments in AI are required before gains trickle to the bottom line. Microsoft is set to shed about $100 billion from its market capitalization if the loses hold until close of trading. Its shares had gained 46.4% up to yesterday's close. ""AI will generate a lot of revenue and earnings for such firms, but a lot of investors have been buying the rumor and now that we have earnings, they are taking profits,"" Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist for Murphy & Sylvest said. ""There's still a lot of excitement around AI, but nobody quite understands what that means for the bottom line of many of these companies."" The NYSE FANG+ index (.NYFANG), which houses many megacap growth names, was down 0.2%. The index has risen about 76% so far this year, driven by the frenzy around AI. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) was an outlier. Its shares rose 5.6% after the company beat expectations for second-quarter results. Alphabet looks set to add about $100 billion to its market capitalization. The recent rally has driven up Microsoft's valuation. The stock is trading at 31 times 12-month forward earnings, compared to a PE multiple of 20 for Alphabet. ""The tech earnings season has started on a mixed note,"" said Mark Haefele, global wealth management chief investment officer at UBS in a client note. ""The tone set by quarterly results over the next week will be crucial to the performance of tech stocks through the rest of the third quarter."" Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the world's most valuable publicly listed company, and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are set to report quarterly earnings next week. FED FEARS vs. AI BOOST Investors also remained cautious on Wednesday, with Wall Street's main indexes muted ahead of a likely Federal Reserve interest rate hike later in the day that could push borrowing costs to their highest since the global financial crisis. Large tech companies, which rely heavily on borrowed money, have been pressured since the Fed started its tightening cycle to tame inflation. However, optimism over AI and hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle have supported tech stocks in recent months. Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital, said tech stocks tend to be fairly exposed to such sentiment around central bank policy as many of them are reliant on robust economic growth to deliver the returns they promise. ""There are valid concerns that the U.S. economy is weakening, but until the Fed sees sustained evidence of softening inflationary pressures, the hawkish stance will be maintained, even at the risk of tipping the economy into negative growth."" Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) shares rose 1.0% after Alibaba's (9988.HK) cloud computing division said it has become the first Chinese enterprise to support the company's open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model Llama. Amazon shares dropped 1.3% after a media report said the Federal Trade Commission is finalizing an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shares tumbled 18.3% after the photo messaging app-owner reported a weaker third-quarter forecast than analysts had expected on Tuesday. ""Band-Aids not fixing bullet holes yet,"" wrote Bernstein stock analyst, Mark Shmulik. The company's Snapchat app has added a new AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions to attract more users, but Shmulik notes the company has struggled to consistently grow revenue and catch up to rivals like Facebook-owner Meta. ""Snapchat is running to stay in the same place while peers enviously get back on the ad growth track,"" Shmulik said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

15,2023-07-26,0.9783,"2023-07-26Alibaba's cloud unit brings Meta's AI model Llama to its clients|HONG KONG, July 26 (Reuters) - Alibaba's (9988.HK) cloud computing division said it has become the first Chinese enterprise to support Meta's (META.O) open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model Llama, allowing its Chinese business users to develop programs off the model. Meta released Llama2, a commercial version of Llama, this month to provide businesses a powerful free-of-charge alternative to pricey proprietary models sold by OpenAI and Google. At the time, Meta said its preferred partner for Llama2 was Microsoft (MSFT.O) but it would also be available through other partners. “Today, Alibaba Cloud has launched the first training and deployment solution for the entire Llama2 series in China, welcoming all developers to create customised large models on Alibaba Cloud,” Alibaba Cloud said in a statement on Tuesday published on its WeChat account. The relationship with Meta could provide sticky customers for Alibaba's cloud business at a time it is facing intensified competition at home and is planning a stock market listing. The U.S. has been actively looking to restrict Chinese companies' access to many U.S.-developed technologies related to AI, particularly in the area of AI semiconductors. The Llama2 move would allow Alibaba to further its own AI ambitions by keeping abreast of the latest developments in the technology. For Meta, whose Facebook social media platform has for years been banned in China along with other Western platforms, it could bring closer ties with the world's second-biggest economy. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment. Alibaba Cloud did not respond to a request for comment. China has been trying to catch up to the U.S. in the field of AI as Beijing encourages Chinese companies to quickly develop homegrown and ""controllable"" AI models that can rival those developed by U.S. companies. Alibaba and its peers such as Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) have been aggressively developing their own AI models in recent months. Similar to models that power popular chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, Llama2 is a large machine learning model that has been trained on a vast amount of data to generate coherent and natural-sounding outputs. According to Meta, Llama2 will be free to use for companies with fewer than 700 million monthly active users. Programs with more users will need to seek a license from Meta. Alibaba also added that if a client wants to use Llama2 to provide services to the Chinese public, it will need to comply with Chinese laws and steer clear of practice and content that may harm the country.

16,2023-07-26,0.9814,"2023-07-26Morning Bid: Markets brace for Fed decision, earnings flood|A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Brigid Riley All eyes are on the Federal Reserve today as the first in a string of central banks to announce interest rate decisions this week. With most market participants expecting a 25 basis-point hike from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) later on Wednesday, the focus will be on the subsequent news conference. Investors will be listening carefully to Chair Jerome Powell for indications of whether or not another interest rate hike is in the pipeline. The Fed's communication could set the tone for markets ahead of policy decisions from the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Friday. The ECB appears poised to make another small hike while the BOJ is widely expected to leave its ultra-easy policy settings on hold. Euro zone June M3 annual growth and lending data on Wednesday are unlikely to affect markets ahead of the ECB's decision. Meta Platforms (META.O) stands out among company earnings reports due on Wednesday in the United States, which also include AT&T (T.N), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO.N), U.S. railroad operator Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), eBay (EBAY.O), Boeing (BA.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N). Both Microsoft and Alphabet announced strong earnings results after the U.S. close on Tuesday. In Europe, France-based retail distributor Carrefour and global foods and beverage company Danone (DANO.PA) report, as do GSK (GSK.L) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI). In Asia, markets are awaiting details on fresh economic stimulus measures from China following the Politburo's pledge on Monday to step up policy support for the faltering economy. Chinese stock markets were mostly lower on Wednesday following a steep rally the day before. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (.HSI) fell 0.8%, trailed by its property and tech subindexes. China's blue-chip CSI300 (.CSI300) index was down 0.3% while the CSI 300 Real Estate index gained 0.2%. Australian CPI data released on Wednesday showed inflation slowed more than expected in the June quarter, giving the Aussie a knock but allowing the Reserve Bank of Australia some breathing room before its next policy meeting on Aug. 1.

The blizzard of market-moving news has done little to rein in the relentless climb of Wall St stocks so far this week, with the S&P500 (.SPX) hitting new highs for the year and the Dow Jones bluechips index (.DJI) clocking a 12th straight daily gain on Tuesday for the first time in six years. Unlucky for some perhaps, but a 13th today would make it the longest winning streak for the Dow since 1987. But this year's supercharged tech sector (.NDX), (.NYFANG) has been more hesitant in returning to the year's highs as its leading lights dish out earnings updates, with a high bar to impress given the scale of AI-infused share price already in 2023. Tesla and Netflix stumbled last week despite headline profit beats and Microsoft's (MSFT.O) ostensible forecast-beating earnings were the latest to underwhelm overnight, as disappointing projections for its cloud business sent its stock down 4% out of hours. Snap plunged 20% before the bell as its guidance fell short too. It not impossible to wow the gallery though. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) climbed 7% after hours as its results beat was accompanied by a surprising rebound in advertising and warmer words on its cloud operations. Meta Platforms (META.O) is up next after Wednesday's closing bell and its share rose 2%. Amazon (AMZN.O) lost 2% on reports the Federal Trade Commission is finalizing an antitrust lawsuit against the firm. The net impact on overall index futures has been marginal so far on Wednesday - a tick down in Nasdaq and Dow futures and a modest nudge up in S&P500. The wider market is held in check awaiting the Federal Reserve's latest quarter-point interest rate rise to 22-year highs of 5.25-5.50%, possibly its last in the cycle if futures are correct. U.S. two-year Treasury yields retreated into the decision and the dollar (.DXY) dialed back too. In the background, the regional bank sector was enlivened by more merger activity. Shares in PacWest (PACW.O) rose nearly 38% in premarket trading after news that smaller rival Banc of California (BANC.N), which rose 14%, had agreed to buy the lender for $1.1 billion. Wells Fargo (WFC.N), meantime, climbed 2.8% after the bank's board authorized a new $30 billion share buyback program. The Fed decision comes in the wake of another set of forecast-beating U.S. consumer confidence readings for July. Economists assume the central bank will retain a hawkish tone but keep its options on another hike open as it will have almost two months of data to assess before meeting again on September 20. Elsewhere, the European earnings season was in full swing too, with banks dominating the diary and the European Central Bank meeting tomorrow. Deutsche Bank < DBKGn.DE> stock fell 1% after the lender reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit as an investment banking slump offset higher interest income. With the Bank of Japan also meeting this week, the yen fell back after a top government official quoted BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda as saying he will maintain accommodative monetary conditions. This week's China's stock rebound (.CSI300) also cooled amid a lack of detail around the Politburo's economic stimulus plans and as property worries continued to rankle. Trading of Chinese property developer Country Garden's (2007.HK) bonds was halted after a more than 20% drop in price on Wednesday.

Australia's Federal Court also ordered Meta, through its subsidiaries Facebook Israel and the now-discontinued app, Onavo, to pay A$400,000 in legal costs to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the civil lawsuit. The fine wraps up one strand of Meta's legal issues in Australia related to its handling of user information since a global scandal erupted over its use of data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 U.S. election. Meta still faces a civil court action by Australia's Office of the Information Commissioner over its dealings with Cambridge Analytica in Australia. Wednesday's judgment was in relation to a virtual private network (VPN) service the company then called Facebook offered from early 2016 to late 2017, Onavo, which it advertised as a way to keep personal information safe. VPNs obscure an internet user's identity by giving their computer a different online address. However, Facebook used Onavo to collect users' location, time and frequency using other smartphone apps, and websites they visited for its own advertising purposes, the judge Wendy Abraham said in a written judgment. ""The failure to make sufficient disclosures ... may have deprived tens of thousands of Australian consumers of the opportunity to make an informed choice about the collection and use of their data before downloading and/or using Onavo Protect,"" Abraham wrote. She added that the court could have fined Meta hundreds of billions of dollars since Australians downloaded the app 271,220 times and each breach of consumer law carried a A$1.1 million fine, but ""the contraventions can be characterised as a single course of conduct"". The fine was agreed by both sides but ""carries with it a sufficient sting to ensure that the penalty amount is not such as to be regarded ... as simply an acceptable cost of doing business"", she wrote. Meta, which made global revenues of $116 billion last year, said in a statement the ACCC had acknowledged it never sought to mislead customers, and ""over the last several years we have built tools to give people more transparency and control over how their data is used"". In a statement, ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said Australian consumers should be able to make an informed choice about what happens to their data based on clear information.

Since generative AI, which uses data to create new content like ChatGPT's human-sounding prose, made headlines early this year, lawmakers around the world began considering how to mitigate the dangers of the emerging technology to national security and the economy.

20,2023-07-25,0.9967,"2023-07-25Alphabet profit beats expectations, CFO Porat to assume new role|SAN FRANCISCO, July 25 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) second-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street expectations on Tuesday and the Google parent announced that its long-time CFO, Ruth Porat, would assume a new role while the company sought a new finance chief. Alphabet's results were helped by steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising. The shares jumped 8% in after-hours trading. Shares of rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) were down slightly after it also reported results on Tuesday, while shares of Meta Platforms (META.O), a company also highly dependent on ad sales, rose as much as 2%. ""Not only did Google deliver fantastic earnings per share, exceeding expectations at a time when investors were questioning its ability to keep up with other tech giants amid the AI frenzy, it also did so by a considerable margin,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""This strongly indicates that a new growth phase for the giant is likely under way."" He added, ""Google has finally consolidated itself as a leading force in the highly-disputed cloud sector and now has room to focus its expansion in the AI field."" Porat, hired in 2015, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent female executives and oversaw tremendous growth at Alphabet. She will become chief investment officer and president starting Sept. 1 and lead 2024 planning while her successor is sought. Porat was hired from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), where she was finance chief. In her new role, she will oversee the company’s so-called Other Bets portfolio, the unit for more risky hardware and services ventures, as well as help manage the company’s global investments. Advertisers, who make up a big share of Alphabet's revenue, have pulled back on spending precious dollars on untested platforms, helping the Google parent as well as Facebook owner Meta Platforms. But Alphabet's second-quarter results are sure to please investors concerned over a broader advertiser pullback following the meteoric growth of Web services during the pandemic, as consumers returned to physical retail. Silicon Valley has been buzzing over generative artificial intelligence software that can give long-winded responses to user queries and is predicted to be the next leap forward for Big Tech. Alphabet rolled out AI products at its annual I/O developer conference in May and it revamped its search engine to include generative AI. The new AI technology comes at a cost: the largest component of Alphabet's second-quarter capital spending was for servers and a ""meaningful investment"" in AI computing, Porat said in a conference call. Advertising is coming to the company's revamped search, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on the call. Alphabet is testing what formats are effective and where to place ads inside of its AI-powered search. Presently, 80% of advertisers use at least one AI-driven search product, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said on the call. The company plans to integrate generative AI into other products such as Gmail, Google Photos and its Android mobile operating system. Generative AI tech can create text, images and video that resemble what people produce. Still, the results released on Tuesday show that ad sales are still king. Investors punished social media company Snap (SNAP.N) on Tuesday for its disappointing ad sales in the quarter. Revenue at Google Cloud, which is among the biggest cloud service providers, rose 28% to $8.1 billion, besting expectations of $7.75 billion, and maintaining roughly the same rate of growth as the first quarter. Microsoft's Azure revenue rose 26%, ahead of the growth estimate from Visible Alpha. Analysts and industry experts have said they expect cloud business growth to pick up toward the end of the year, with quarter-ended June being the trough as macro uncertainty begins to clear. Investors expect AI to become a major growth driver for cloud businesses within a year, with Microsoft's Azure leading the pack followed by Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) AWS and Google Cloud. Ad sales for Google's YouTube video service unit rose 4.4% to $7.67 billion. Alphabet reported net profit of $1.44 per share for the April-June period, compared with estimates of $1.34 per share. Revenue for the quarter stood at $74.6 billion, compared with estimates of $72.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

21,2023-07-25,0.9732,"2023-07-25Snap shares drop on softer Q3 outlook as app tries to revamp ads|July 25 (Reuters) - Photo messaging app-owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) on Tuesday gave weaker third quarter guidance than analysts had expected as it works to compete with tech giants for advertising dollars, sending its shares down 18%. The company's Snapchat app has attracted hundreds of millions of users thanks to its lighthearted photo filters and new AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions. But it has struggled to consistently grow revenue and catch up to rivals like Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) that reach a much larger audience, prompting questions from analysts and investors about its strategy. Santa Monica, California-based Snap said it estimates third quarter revenue will be between $1.07 billion to $1.13 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $1.13 billion, at the top end of the guidance range. Similarly, Wall Street forecast 406.2 million users in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, but Snap said it expects between 405 million to 406 million daily active users. Shares of Snap dropped 18% to $10.19 in after-market trading following the results. Snap's weak outlook ""highlights concerns that advertising money is not going to the smaller social media networks amid the constrained economic environment,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. Earlier this year, the company updated its machine learning model to serve more relevant promotions to users, which Snap said in the short term caused a small number of its largest advertisers to see fewer ""actions,"" such as users tapping on ads, than they did previously Advertisers are beginning to see results from the changes, which led to a more than 30% increase in ""purchase-related conversions"" compared to the first quarter, Snap told investors. The improvements also helped Snap grow the total number of advertisers on its platform, though it is not yet enough to make up for the lower ad demand from some larger brands, it added. During a conference call with analysts, Snap's chief financial officer Derek Andersen said the consumer packaged goods, restaurants and travel industries were strong, but advertisers in other sectors continued to face economic challenges. Still, the tech company beat revenue and user estimates for the second quarter. Revenue for the quarter ending June 30 was $1.07 billion, beating analyst expectations of $1.05 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Daily active users on Snapchat rose 14% year-over-year to 397 million, beating Wall Street expectations of 394.8 million. More than 150 million people have also sent more than 10 billion messages to My AI, the ChatGPT-powered bot Snap launched in February. Those conversations will help Snap learn more about user interests and lead to more relevant ads, the company said, adding that it is testing sponsored links in My AI's responses. Snap's net loss was $377 million during the second quarter, narrowing from a net loss of $422 million the previous year. Several analysts questioned Snap's plan to spend more on infrastructure, which the company said would cost between 79 cents to 84 cents per daily active user in the third quarter, up from 70 cents from the second quarter. Andersen said the spending aimed to improve its ads platform and grow user engagement with content. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9732"
22,2023-07-25,0.8591,"2023-07-25Twitter blue bird has flown as Musk says X logo is here|July 24 (Reuters) - After 17 years with an iconic blue bird that came to symbolize the broadcasting of ideas to the world, billionaire Elon Musk renamed Twitter as X and unveiled a new logo, marking a focus on building an ""everything app."" On Monday, a stylized white X on a black background became the new logo on Twitter's website, though the blue bird was still seen on the mobile app. Since taking over Twitter in October, Musk has said he envisions an app that could offer a variety of services to users beyond social media, such as peer-to-peer payments, an idea that mirrors the widely popular WeChat app in China. The transformation is more simply a way for Musk to make his mark on the company, said Tom Morton, global chief strategy officer at ad agency R/GA. ""Twitter's changing name and logo has nothing to do with user, advertiser, or market issues. It's a symbol that Twitter is Elon Musk's personal property. ""He conquered the castle, now he's flying his own flag."" The new logo garnered mixed reactions from users and sparked confusion about what tweets would now be called, while marketing and branding experts said the rebrand risked throwing away years of Twitter's name recognition. ""Only a few brands have become verbs or seen themselves referred to in global news outlets as often as Twitter has,"" said Matt Rhodes, strategy lead at creative agency House 337, which has worked with British telecom company Sky. ""Anything that makes it harder for people to find, or want to open the app on their cluttered phone screens risks harming usage,"" he said. Fernando Machado, who previously held chief marketing officer roles at Activision Blizzard, Restaurant Brands International and Burger King, said rebrands typically take time to sink in, though ""as a Twitter user, I confess that I miss the little bird already."" ""Personally, I think the new approach feels a bit cold and impersonal,"" he said. Outside Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco on Monday, police stopped construction workers from removing the Twitter sign, in a scene witnessed by a Reuters reporter. On one side of the building, only the blue bird and the letters ""er"" were left. ""#GoodbyeTwitter"" was trending on the platform on Monday with reference to the old logo as some users criticized the new one. Musk tweeted on Saturday that ""soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds"".

REUTERS/Carlos Barria In response to a tweet asking what will tweets be called under X, Musk replied ""x's"". Musk has used the letter X repeatedly across his companies. He co-founded x.com as an online bank in 1999 which later transformed into PayPal. He bought the domain back from PayPal in 2017, saying it had ""sentimental value"". The domain x.com now redirects to Twitter. Linda Yaccarino, the former advertising chief at NBCUniversal who started as Twitter CEO on June 5, told employees in a memo on Monday that X ""will go even further to transform the global town square."" The company will work on new features in audio, video, messaging, payments and banking, according to the memo, which was seen by Reuters. The platform will face challenges to reinvent its business. Since Musk's takeover, the company has faced tumultuous times with layoffs, a sharp drop in advertisers and the meteoric rise of Threads, Meta's response to Twitter. The billionaire's decision to rebrand Twitter as X could be complicated legally: X is widely used and cited in trademarks, and companies including Meta and Microsoft already have intellectual property rights to the same letter. The rebrand indicates Musk has given up on any plans ""to revive Twitter as a powerful stand-alone social network and simply considers the $44 billion spent on the network a sunk cost,"" said Niklas Myhr, a professor of marketing at Chapman University. ""The last few months have been tumultuous at Twitter, and I don't think a new brand is going to solve everything,"" Drew Benvie, CEO of social media consultancy Battenhall, said. ""This is less about reinventing Twitter, and more about building a brand around Elon Musk's empire, including SpaceX, where the X branding really connects a little more closely.""

Its offer also included limiting the use of advertising data to develop products that compete with advertisers, the people said. Meta's proposal, similar to one made to the UK competition agency in May, suggests that the company will have to do more to counter the EU watchdog's charges if it wants to stave off a possible fine. However, the sources said Meta was not expected to improve its offer. The UK enforcer in a preliminary view has said Meta's offer addresses its concerns. Companies risk fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover for EU antitrust violations. The world's most popular social network sought to settle the EU investigation opened in June last year, other people familiar with the matter told Reuters last December. Details of Meta's proposed concessions had not been previously reported on. Both the European Commission and Meta declined to comment. The EU antitrust watchdog last December charged Meta with abusing its market power through two practices, one of which was tying its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace with its social network Facebook. The other was allegedly its unfair trading conditions imposed on rival online classified ads services which advertise on Facebook or Instagram. Meta contested the EU charges at a closed hearing earlier this month. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|-0.6597"

26,2023-07-25,0.9484,"2023-07-25Meta, Microsoft, hundreds more own trademarks to new Twitter name|July 24 (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk's decision to rebrand Twitter as X could be complicated legally: companies including Meta (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) already have intellectual property rights to the same letter. X is so widely used and cited in trademarks that it is a candidate for legal challenges - and the company formerly known as Twitter could face its own issues defending its X brand in the future. ""There's a 100% chance that Twitter is going to get sued over this by somebody,"" said trademark attorney Josh Gerben, who said he counted nearly 900 active U.S. trademark registrations that already cover the letter X in a wide range of industries. Musk renamed social media network Twitter as X on Monday and unveiled a new logo for the social media platform, a stylized black-and-white version of the letter. Owners of trademarks - which protect things like brand names, logos and slogans that identify sources of goods - can claim infringement if other branding would cause consumer confusion. Remedies range from monetary damages to blocking use. Microsoft since 2003 has owned an X trademark related to communications about its Xbox video-game system. Meta Platforms - whose Threads platform is a new Twitter rival - owns a federal trademark registered in 2019 covering a blue-and-white letter ""X"" for fields including software and social media. Meta and Microsoft likely would not sue unless they feel threatened that Twitter's X encroaches on brand equity they built in the letter, Gerben said. The three companies did not respond to requests for comment. Meta itself drew intellectual property challenges when it changed its name from Facebook. It faces trademark lawsuits filed last year by investment firm Metacapital and virtual-reality company MetaX, and settled another over its new infinity-symbol logo. And if Musk succeeds in changing the name, others still could claim 'X' for themselves. ""Given the difficulty in protecting a single letter, especially one as popular commercially as 'X', Twitter's protection is likely to be confined to very similar graphics to their X logo,"" said Douglas Masters, a trademark attorney at law firm Loeb & Loeb. ""The logo does not have much distinctive about it, so the protection will be very narrow."" Insider reported earlier that Meta had an X trademark, and lawyer Ed Timberlake tweeted that Microsoft had one as well. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The change, which was not evident on the website on Sunday evening, followed Musk's recent admission that advertising revenue remains nearly half of what it once was. And Twitter's cash flow has been negative as a result of that and its heavy debt load. Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester, said on Sunday that the move would further alienate Twitter's original, and once fiercely loyal, user base. ""On the one hand, you can make the argument he would be getting rid of an iconic brand. On the other hand, he is signaling it is a new day for what was once Twitter and that the company is heading in a different direction with a different user base.""

Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square."" Under Musk's tumultuous tenure since he bought Twitter in October, the company has changed its business name to X Corp, reflecting the billionaire's vision to create a ""super app"" like China's WeChat. In April, Twitter's legacy blue bird logo was temporarily replaced by Dogecoin's Shiba Inu dog, helping drive a surge in the cryptocurrency's market value. The company came under widespread criticism from users and marketing professionals when Musk announced early this month that Twitter would limit how many tweets per day various accounts can read.

""The unprecedented adoption of ... Threads now also offers Meta some material greenshoots to get excited about,"" they said, while cautioning that it was still early days and other upstarts like Clubhouse had fizzled out. Morningstar analysts said on July 11 that Threads could add between $2 billion and $3 billion to Meta's revenue every year between 2024 and 2027.

In the hope that Threads will flourish - thanks to Meta's deep pockets and experience with successfully running Instagram and Facebook - and expectation it will introduce advertising eventually, some brands may already be considering how much money to set aside for future marketing campaigns on the app, analysts and ad industry executives said. Taylor Michelle Gerard, a senior executive at content marketing firm Blue Hour Studios, said some of her clients are considering adding a Threads post along with TikTok or Instagram posts as part of sponsored deals with influencers. ""It's a nice way to work Threads into an existing campaign,"" she said. Once Threads ads are available, brands will move their ad spending over from Twitter ""without question,"" said Matt Yanofsky, co-founder of Moment Lab, a brand marketing and advertising agency. He said some of his clients, who he did not name, are already examining whether to add a budget for Threads ads later this year. Meta did not comment for this article. Some advertisers have already moved away from Twitter due to concerns about the tone of discourse and abrupt changes in policies since Musk bought the firm last year, said Andrew La Fond, a vice president at ad agency R/GA, which has worked with Nike (NKE.N). Twitter did not respond to an email seeking comment. It has said it does not promote content that may violate its policies and that 99.99% of tweet impressions, or views, are of ""healthy"" content. It has acknowledged falling ad sales - last week Musk said they had dropped 50%, although it was unclear what time-frame he was referring to. In response, it has done some advertiser outreach. Two days after Threads launched, Twitter emailed a major ad-buying firm reminding them of the incentives that the company was offering to advertisers and noting the firm had spent less on Twitter ads this year, according to the email viewed by Reuters. Threads still has a long way to go before it equals Twitter's reach, though. Twitter had nearly 240 million monetizable daily active users as of July last year, according to the company's last public disclosure. Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has said the company would only think about monetizing Threads once there was a clear path to 1 billion users. Tens of millions of users come back to Threads daily, and the team will focus the rest of the year on ""improving the basics and retention,"" Zuckerberg posted on Threads last week. After being slow to adopt AI-friendly hardware and software systems for its main business, Meta has invested to upgrade its AI capacity to boost traffic to Facebook and Instagram and increase ad sales. It has also narrowed its cost outlook for the year after pandemic-era excesses. On Wednesday, when Meta reports results for the April-June period, the company is expected to post an 8% increase in quarterly revenue to $31.1 billion, its best growth in six quarters. Threads does not yet support direct messaging, hashtags or keyword searches, which limits its appeal to advertisers and its utility as a place for following real-time events like users frequently do on Twitter. Nonetheless, many brands are experimenting on Threads, which has ""made social media feel fun again,"" said Liz Bartges, director of brand engagement at communications agency FerebeeLane. ""We're reliving the glory days of Twitter,"" she said about Threads. ""I'm excited to see where it could go."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

31,2023-07-24,0.9952,"2023-07-24Big Tech looks to turn the corner on cloud as AI focus stays strong|July 24 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giants could signal an end to the nearly year-long slowdown in their cloud businesses as signs of economic resilience encourage clients to boost technology spending, while a pickup in digital ads will also aid profits. Microsoft, Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon.com and Meta Platforms — companies that are together valued at over $6 trillion — are set to report earnings this week and the next, in what will be a test for their hefty valuations and the broader market rally they have driven thanks to optimism over artificial intelligence. ""We're really only looking for metrics that point to ramping user traction for AI-based offerings, with the idea being that they will generate more meaningful revenue in the medium-term,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane said. The four companies have this year aggressively integrated AI into their products on hopes that it would drive the industry's next growth cycle, but those efforts will take time to pay off. For Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) — the three biggest players in the cloud market — the April-June quarter is expected to mark another period of dismal growth in the business that has long been a cash cow. Both Amazon and Alphabet will likely report their lowest-ever growth for the cloud computing business at 9.8% and 24.4%, respectively, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv. Meanwhile Microsoft Intelligent Cloud, home to Azure, is expected to grow at 13.7%, the slowest rate since 2017. However, several analysts believe the trend is about to change. ""While the macro continues to be soft, it is not getting materially worse and companies are figuring out how to operate in this,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said. The current quarter will also have easier year-ago comparisons as the cloud slowdown started in the September quarter of 2022, Jaluria added. A recent survey by RBC Capital of more than 150 enterprise technology buyers showed that over four-fifth of them were funding projects related to generative AI and they broadly expect IT spending to increase this year over 2022. For Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O), revenue is expected to grow at its fastest pace in six quarters thanks to a pickup in the digital advertising market as consumer spending stays strong. ""If the digital ad space is like riding a roller coaster, we are just about done with the boring/tough part, slowly climbing to the top chain link by chain link,"" Bernstein analysts said. The digital ad market recovery will also aid Alphabet, whose Google Search has so far avoided any meaningful market share loss to Microsoft's AI-powered Bing. Alphabet is expected to report 4.5% revenue growth in the April-June period, its best in three quarters. ""Google Search has seemingly shifted from market share risk to monetization risk, but with search share seemingly healthy, Google may have less urgency to integrate LLM (large-language model) results into commercial queries,"" analysts at BofA Global Research said. Microsoft and Alphabet will report quarterly results on July 25, Meta on July 26 and Amazon on Aug. 3. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9952"
32,2023-07-24,0.9762,"2023-07-24Morning Bid: Euro biz ebbs, China property and rate peaks?|A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Another worrying drop in European business activity and a fresh property sector jolt in China encourages speculation the world's two most powerful central banks may end interest rate tightening campaigns this week with their final hikes of the cycle. In a week packed with market-moving events - G3 central bank decisions, mega-cap tech earnings, a Chinese Politburo meeting and second-quarter U.S. output numbers - the prospect of peak U.S. and euro zone interest rates will loom large. Futures markets assume the Federal Reserve's expected quarter-point hike to 5.25-5.50% on Wednesday will be its last of a 16-month squeeze, with less than a 50% chance of a further move later in the year priced. And money markets also see the European Central Bank's likely quarter point rate rise to 3.75% the following day as the last, again placing less than a 50-50 chance of another hike after that. The Bank of Japan is expected to hold the line on its super-easy money policy for now. Arguments for calling a halt to the credit tightening were strengthened on Monday as early July business surveys for the euro area came in well below forecasts, showing a deepening contraction in overall activity this month. The euro dropped more than half a percent against the dollar as euro government debt yields fell back, with an indecisive weekend election result in Spain adding pressure. With the ongoing slide in manufacturing still the biggest drag and due in large part to China's spluttering post-Covid recovery, further turbulence in China's property markets will only increase the anxiety. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index (.HSI), down more than 5% for the year so far, dropped another 2% on Monday and its index of mainland property developers (.HSMPI) plunged 6.4% - its second biggest daily drop of 2023. Debt repayment concerns at two of the country's biggest developers - Country Garden and Dalian Wanda - deepened a crisis of confidence in the sector. China's ruling Politburo met on Monday to shape its strategy for the year ahead and early local media readouts said it expects the economic recovery to be 'tortuous' requiring macro adjustments of a precise and forceful manner. Markets have worried that any stimulus to the flagging economy to date have largely been piecemeal moves. Hopes the BOJ stands pat on monetary policy helped Japan's Nikkei (.N225) outperform and it jumped more than 1%. For Wall St, the looming Fed decision dominates this week - with a check on U.S. July business surveys topping the data on Monday's calendar in another huge corporate earnings week. Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) report on Tuesday and Meta (META.O) is due out Wednesday, with massive 70%-plus share price gains so far this year for the mega cap tech vanguard index (.NYFANG) raising the bar and investors keen to hold AI-related excitement up to the light. Wall St's main stock indices ended marginally higher on Friday, with the Dow Jones bluechip index (.DJI) eking out its 10th consecutive daily gain for the first time in more than six years. Both S&P500 and Nasdaq futures pushed higher again on Monday, although the VIX volatility gauge (.VIX) popped to its highest in almost two weeks. U.S. Treasury yields fell back, but the dollar (.DXY) climbed against the euro, yuan and sterling - also hit by disappointing UK business readings for July. Events to watch for on Monday: * S&P Global July flash business surveys from the United States and around the world, Chicago Fed June business survey * U.S. corporate earnings: Whirlpool, Domino's Pizza, Brown & Brown, Alexandria Real Estate, NXP, Packaging Corp of America, F5, Cadence Design Systems * World Trade Organization general council meets in Geneva * U.S. Treasury auctions 2-year notes, 3- and 6-month bills Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9762"
33,2023-07-24,0.9229,"2023-07-24Morning Bid: Markets bide time as policymakers plot next moves|SYDNEY, July 24 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Stella Qiu It's a week that every investor has squarely on their radar: Three of the world's biggest central banks will deliver their latest policy moves and China's Politburo - its top policymaking body - is set to unveil support measures as the economy sputters. Meanwhile, markets seem to be biding their time. On Monday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was off a slight 0.3%, European stock futures were marginally lower and U.S. futures were flat. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HSI) was a bit of an outlier on the downside with a drop of 1.5%, dragged lower by Chinese property developers (.HSMPI) which tumbled more than 5%. With a quarter-point hike from both the Federal Reserve (on Wednesday) and the European Central Bank (on Thursday) looking set in stone, the focus will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde say about the rate outlook. If markets are right, this should be the last hike from the Fed and second-to-last from the ECB, as investors look ahead to the end of the great synchronised global tightening campaign - and rate cuts that may soon follow. , The U.S. earnings season will also move into higher gear this week with Meta Platforms (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) among the big names reporting. Their results will have to be good enough to justify the S&P 500's earning multiple of 20 times and its gains of 19% year-to-date. In Asia, contrary to what some investors were expecting, the Bank of Japan，which meets on Friday，is leaning towards keeping its yield control policy unchanged so that policymakers can scrutinise more data to ensure wages and inflation keep rising, sources told Reuters. That report sent the yen to a two-week low of 141.95 per dollar on Friday but the currency regained some composure in Asia as the new week began, steadying at 141.36 per dollar. Manufacturing activity in Japan extended declines in July while growth in the service sector slowed, surveys showed on Monday, a sign that global demand remains week and is weighing on Japanese businesses. For those looking for major stimulus from China's politburo meeting, which is expected to come on Friday, they risk disappointment again after months of anticipation. Piecemeal support measures from the government's various agencies in recent days to prop up the property sector and consumption have failed to impress. Beijing likes to do things on its own time and, after all, growth is still tracking in line with the government's economic target for the year of about 5%, although some big global banks have only recently cut their forecasts to come in line with that.

34,2023-07-23,0.9022,"2023-07-23Morning Bid: G3 central banks and China Politburo bonanza|July 24 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. The week ahead could be pivotal to the financial market landscape for the rest of the year, as the G3 central banks deliver their latest policy decisions and China's Politburo of the ruling Communist Party meets to discuss the economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan decisions and press conferences all come over the Wednesday-Friday 48-hour period, and China's Politburo is expected to begin its meet on Friday. If that wasn't enough, purchasing managers index figures will give the first indications on how economies performed in July. The U.S. earnings season moves up a gear with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet among the big names reporting. Dovish signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell would probably boost risk appetite and lift global stocks markets. The dollar and U.S. bond yields would likely come under downward pressure too - often bullish triggers for Asian and emerging markets. Investors in Asia have to wait until Friday for the big two set pieces of the week. More than three quarters of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to keep policy unchanged, including its yield control scheme. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his resolve to maintain massive monetary stimulus, despite inflation persistently outpacing the bank's 2% target. In a symbolic development last week, Japan's annual rate of headline consumer inflation rose above comparable U.S. inflation for the first time since 2015. But the BOJ's deflation battle scars run deep, so investor hopes of and end to super-loose policy are being pushed back further. It's a different story in China - the economy and markets are badly underperforming, growth forecasts are being slashed, and the big danger is deflation, not inflation. The central bank has been reluctant to ease policy because the already weak yuan could come under even greater selling pressure, so investors are pinning their hopes on a fiscal boost from Beijing. And it will have to be a significant boost. Measures announced on Friday to help boost sales of cars and electronics failed to impress investors, and foreigners are steering clear of China's financial assets even though they are relatively cheap. But the economic, financial, political and social challenges Beijing faces are such that Chinese stocks can get even cheaper before foreign investors start buying again en masse. Monday's economic data calendar and potential market-movers in Asia will be the Japanese and Australian PMIs, and the latest inflation figures from Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysian inflation is expected to fall to 2.4% in June - the lowest since April last year - from 2.8% in May. Singapore's inflation is seen falling to 4.55% - the lowest since February last year - from 5.10%.

35,2023-07-23,0.9693,"2023-07-23Cambodia PM's party claims landslide election win ahead of historic transition|PHNOM PENH, July 23 (Reuters) - The ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) declared a landslide victory in a one-sided election on Sunday, clearing the path for a historic leadership transition and the end of the reign of one of the world's longest-serving premiers. The contest was effectively a one-horse race, with Prime Minister Hun Sen's CPP, a political behemoth with a vast war chest, facing no viable opponent after a ruthless, years-long crackdown that has seen hundreds of its rivals flee into exile. The CPP was leading in ballot counting late on Sunday, with a turnout of 84%, according to the election committee, with 8.1 million people voting in a lopsided contest between the CPP and 17 mostly obscure parties. ""We've won in a landslide ... but we can't calculate the number of seats yet,"" CPP spokesperson Sok Eysan said. Self-styled strongman Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for 38 years, had brushed off Western concern about the election's credibility, determined to prevent any obstacle in his carefully calibrated transition to his anointed successor and eldest son, Hun Manet. No timeframe had been given for the handover until Thursday, when Hun Sen, 70, signalled that Western-educated military general Hun Manet ""could be"" prime minister next month. A National Assembly seat would makes him eligible, if backed by the house. Party spokesperson Sok Eysan said it was ""very clear"" Hun Manet won a seat. Hun Manet has given few media interviews and no clues over his vision for Cambodia and its 16 million people. He earned a master's degree at New York University and a doctorate at the University of Bristol, both in economics, and attended the West Point military academy, helping him rise through the ranks of Cambodia's military to army chief and deputy armed forces commander. Major powers will be watching closely for signs of whether Hun Manet will maintain the authoritarian status quo of his father or pursue greater liberalisation and a more Western style of democracy. After casting his vote on Sunday, Hun Manet ducked questions about becoming premier and whether he would rule differently from his father. [1/8]Hun Manet, son of Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen is seen at a polling station on the day of Cambodia's general election, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, July 23, 2023. REUTERS/Cindy Liu     ""No comment please. I've just come to vote,"" he said in English, smiling. Analysts had expected the transition to come mid-term, giving Hun Manet time to earn legitimacy with the public and political elite. A key focus will be if he seeks to steer Cambodia out of the orbit of China and patch up ties with the United States that have perennially been strained by his father's iron-fisted approach. A CPP rout was never in doubt after preemptive strikes by authorities that included disqualifying the CPP's only meaningful rival, the Candlelight Party, over a paperwork technicality. Former Khmer Rouge guerrilla Hun Sen has been accused by activists of publicly threatening rivals and inciting violence, which led to Meta Platforms' oversight board recommending his suspension from Facebook. The government has denied persecuting opponents. The election committee also banned self-exiled opposition figurehead Sam Rainsy and 16 allies from elections for two decades for urging Cambodians to destroy ballots in protest. Some did that, posting images of their ballots on social media, some with writing disparaging Hun Sen and calling him a coward. Another ballot said ""U.N. pls help"". ""The surprise of the day will be the number and the percentage of 'spoiled' ballots,"" Rainsy said on Twitter. ""You can't win an election with no opposition."" Despite the CPP government's stranglehold over independent institutions, including the poll body, and allegations by activists of complicity in land grabs and environmental destruction, the party has consistently won the rural vote, reflecting improvements in basic infrastructure. Its selling point has been ensuring peace and stability after decades of war, which spurred average growth of more than 7% until 2019, creating jobs in garment manufacturing and construction. Hun Sen said the turnout, the highest in three decades, showed his ""extremist"" opponents had failed to derail the election. He urged those who destroyed ballots not to flee the country and suggested they own up. ""We already know your faces,"" he said on Telegram. ""Don't be afraid, you may come out and confess ... otherwise, legal measures will be taken."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9693"

Netflix (NFLX.O) dipped 2.3%, down for a second straight day after the video streaming company's quarterly results this week failed to impress. Analysts attributed Friday's volatile trading to the expiration of monthly options and the expected special rebalancing of the multi-trillion dollar Nasdaq 100 (.NDX) following the close of trading. The S&P 500 climbed 0.03% to end at 4,536.34 points. The Nasdaq declined 0.22% to 14,032.81 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01% to 35,227.69 points. For the week, the S&P 500 added 0.7%, the Nasdaq fell 0.6% and the Dow rose 2.1%. The Nasdaq has rallied about 34% this year, lifted by optimism over artificial intelligence, a relatively resilient U.S. economy and expectations that the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike cycle will end soon. While the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its July 25-26 meeting, investors have mixed views on the central bank's longer-term monetary policy. American Express (AXP.N) fell 3.9% after the credit card giant missed quarterly revenue estimates and affirmed its full-year profit forecast. SLB (SLB.N) declined 2.2% after the top oilfield services firm missed quarterly revenue expectations due to moderating drilling activity in North America.

37,2023-07-21,0.997,"2023-07-21OpenAI, Google, others pledge to watermark AI content for safety, White House says|WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) have made voluntary commitments to the White House to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to help make the technology safer, President Joe Biden announced on Friday. ""These commitments are a promising step but we have a lot more work to do together,"" Biden said. At a White House event, Biden addressed growing concerns about the potential for artificial intelligence to be used for disruptive purposes, saying ""we must be clear-eyed and vigilant about the threats from emerging technologies"" to U.S. democracy. The companies - which also include Anthropic, Inflection, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and OpenAI partner Microsoft (MSFT.O) - pledged to thoroughly test systems before releasing them and share information about how to reduce risks and invest in cybersecurity. The move is seen as a win for the Biden administration's effort to regulate the technology, which has experienced a boom in investment and consumer popularity. ""We welcome the president’s leadership in bringing the tech industry together to hammer out concrete steps that will help make AI safer, more secure, and more beneficial for the public,"" Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday. Since generative AI, which uses data to create new content like ChatGPT's human-sounding prose, became wildly popular this year, lawmakers around the world began considering how to mitigate the dangers of the emerging technology to national security and the economy. The U.S. lags the EU in tackling artificial intelligence regulation. In June, EU lawmakers agreed to a set of draft rules where systems like ChatGPT would have to disclose AI-generated content, help distinguish so-called deep-fake images from real ones and ensure safeguards against illegal content. U.S. Senate Majority Chuck Schumer in June called for ""comprehensive legislation"" to advance and ensure safeguards on artificial intelligence. Congress is considering a bill that would require political ads to disclose whether AI was used to create imagery or other content. Biden, who hosted executives from the seven companies at the White House on Friday, said he is also working on developing an executive order and bipartisan legislation on AI technology. ""We'll see more technology change in the next 10 years, or even in the next few years, than we've seen in the last 50 years. That has been an astounding revelation to me, quite frankly,"" Biden said. As part of the effort, the seven companies committed to developing a system to ""watermark"" all forms of content, from text, images, audios, to videos generated by AI so that users will know when the technology has been used. This watermark, embedded in the content in a technical manner, presumably will make it easier for users to spot deep-fake images or audios that may, for example, show violence that has not occurred, create a better scam or distort a photo of a politician to put the person in an unflattering light. It is unclear how the watermark will be evident in the sharing of the information. The companies also pledged to focus on protecting users' privacy as AI develops and on ensuring that the technology is free of bias and not used to discriminate against vulnerable groups. Other commitments include developing AI solutions to scientific problems like medical research and mitigating climate change. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The stock's gain puts it on course for its best day since November last year and is the highest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC). The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which in October 2021 agreed to take Truth Social-parent Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) public, agreed to pay $18 million in fine to settle charges that it had made ""material misrepresentations"" to investors if it closes the merger. ""It was weighing on shares and this gives investors hope that a deal could be completed,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader and equity market structure analyst at Triple D Trading. If the deal consummates, TMTG will have more than $1 billion of cash in its reach from the SPAC's institutional investors.
