Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Li Gu in Shanghai, Amanda Cooper, Lawrence White and Dhara Ranasinghe in London, and Ira Iosebashvili in New York 1/KEEP CALM AND BET ON STERLING When the Bank of England meets on Aug 2, policymakers will finally have something to cheer about. Inflation hasn't accelerated since February and there are signs that widespread price pressures are starting to abate. But the BoE has been routinely accused of being behind the curve. It's taken policymakers eight months to bring inflation down to 7.9%, from a peak of 11.1%. It took the ECB half that time to achieve the same rate of decline. Money markets show traders think the odds are split on a 25-bp or a 50-bp hike. Investors are all too aware of how much more work the BoE has to do. After all, they're holding the most valuable bullish bet on sterling since 2014. Meanwhile, markets will also work through the fallout from the Bank of Japan's move on Friday to make its yield curve control policy more flexible and water down its commitment to defend a cap on long-term interest rates. The Fed appears to have gone into data-dependent mode after hiking rates 25 bps on Wednesday to 5.25-5.50% - a level last seen just before 2007 housing crash. Between now and its next meeting in September, the Fed gets two sets of jobs data - and inflation numbers - to pore over. First up is July non-farm payrolls on Aug. 4. Resilient jobs growth has been a key factor in shaping investors' benign outlook on the U.S. economy, a view that - along with ebbing inflation - has helped drive rallies in stocks and other risk assets this year. Signs of an overly robust labour market could spark worries that the Fed needs to keep tightening monetary policy to contain inflation. Conversely, a steep drop-off in employment might rekindle recession fears. Megacaps Apple and Amazon meanwhile are expected to report earnings on Aug. 3. Markets are impatient. The ECB just hiked rates - as expected - again and the 'will they' or 'won't they' lift rates in September debate is well under way. So even as rate-setters head for a break, data will still push around rate bets, starting with Monday's preliminary estimate of July euro zone inflation and second quarter GDP. Overall inflation is now just half its October peak, but harder-to-break underlying price growth is hovering near historic highs and may have even accelerated again. Both measures remain above the ECB's 2% inflation target. Economists polled by Reuters forecast the euro zone economy grew 0.2% in Q2. GDP was flat in Q1 versus the previous quarter. The data could strengthen the case for a September hike. Not so fast, ECB doves might argue. After all, forward-looking indicators such as PMIs are pointing decidedly lower. HSBC (HSBA.L) on Tuesday closes out a mixed reporting season for big European banks, with investment banking revenues still dwindling as deal activity slumps, while rising rates lift more staid business lines such as corporate and retail banking. Investors are hoping for a fresh share buyback after HSBC announced a $2 billion offer last quarter and resumed paying quarterly dividends for the first time since 2019. They will also look for an increase to the bank's conservative-looking $34 billion net interest income forecast. HSBC investors have long awaited the promised land, where rising central bank interest rates lift margins from lending against its vast deposit base, but the picture is clouded in Britain by political pressure to pay stressed savers more. And China's precarious economic recovery could in turn revive fears about HSBC's nearly $10 billion exposure to the overextended commercial real state sector. Hopes for stimulus from Beijing for China's embattled property sector are well and alive, if property shares in Hong Kong and the mainland at multi-week highs are anything to go by. Removing the phrase ""houses are for living, not for speculation"" from a readout of the powerful politburo meeting fuelled those hopes, but there's been a distinct lack of concrete detail. A booming property market is seen as key to igniting lacklustre missing consumer spending in post-pandemic China. But Beijing will be wary. Memories of previous property sector bubbles are fresh and developers are still feeling the fallout. Sino-Ocean Group (3377.HK) is considering a debt deferral, Dalian Wanda Commercial Management almost defaulted, and Country Garden (2007.HK) faces mounting payment pressures in the coming months. Purchasing manager surveys in days to come are likely to offer few promising signs, after Thursday's industrial profits numbers extend the double-digit pace of declines into a sixth month.

Retention of users on the text-based app was better than executives had expected, though it was ""not perfect,"" said Zuckerberg, speaking at an internal company town hall, the audio of which was heard by Reuters. ""Obviously, if you have more than 100 million people sign up, ideally it would be awesome if all of them or even half of them stuck around. We're not there yet,"" he said. Zuckerberg said he considered the drop-off ""normal"" and expected retention to grow as the company adds more features to the app, including a desktop version and search functionality. Meta is looking at adding more ""retention-driving hooks"" to entice users to return to the app, like ""making sure people who are on the Instagram app can see important Threads,"" said Chief Product Officer Chris Cox. A company spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting. The executives' comments came a day after Meta wowed investors with a rosy revenue growth forecast, a sign of a comeback for a company that faced deep skepticism over its hefty spending on the metaverse last year as ad sales plummeted. The disclosure sent Meta's shares surging 8% on Thursday. Zuckerberg told employees on the call that he believed the company's work on the augmented and virtual reality technology that would power the metaverse was ""not massively ahead of schedule, but on track."" Meta, he added, needed to get started investing in that work ahead of rivals such as Apple (AAPL.O), Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O), given their years of experience building operating systems for existing products. ""That way, we have all the tools ready for when this is ready for prime time,"" he said, predicting that mass adoption of metaverse technologies would take place in the 2030s. Zuckerberg and Cox also highlighted the company's release of an artificial intelligence model called Llama 2 this month, which it made freely available for commercial use to any developer whose services had fewer than 700 million users. The model has received more than 150,000 download requests in the week since its release, Cox said. Responding to a question on the proposed ""cage match"" against Elon Musk, Zuckerberg said he was ""not sure if it's going to come together.""

3,2023-07-28,0.99,"2023-07-28US Senate Democrats push 'Buy America' bills ahead of tough 2024 elections|WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - Facing uphill re-election battles in 2024, vulnerable Senate Democrats are pushing legislation that promotes ""Buy America"" policies, attempting to bolster their party on a brand of economic populism they hope will keep them in the majority. The Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday advanced a bill from Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin and Republican Senator J.D. Vance to require country of origin labeling for goods sold online, bringing them in line with brick-and-mortar goods. On Wednesday, a Senate committee approved Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown's bill requiring all American flags bought by the U.S. government to be made in the United States, and last week the Senate passed an amendment from Baldwin to an annual defense policy bill requiring the Navy to build ships in the United States with American materials. ""There's definitely momentum,"" Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan and chair of the Senate Democrats' campaign committee, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as a galvanizing force. ""We had very efficient supply chains, but they weren't resilient. The way you get resilience is to make sure all those products are made in the United States."" Senators serve six-year terms, and Democrats hold a narrow majority in the chamber. Next year, Democrats face headwinds when more of their members will be defending seats than Republicans. Many of those Democrats come from states that former President Donald Trump won in 2016 or 2020, including Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, all of which have major manufacturing industries and high union populations. Buy America policies are ""mom-and-apple pie issues with American voters"" that have ""virtually universal support,"" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said. ""In addition to having a good jobs impact, there's also a good political impact."" Although Democrats have long been the party of labor unions, Trump's anti-China, pro-American-worker message in 2016 challenged that notion after blue-collar voters without college degrees flipped to him in droves, said Nick Iacovella, vice president at the Coalition for a Prosperous America which represents domestic producers. In the aftermath of Trump's win, both parties are scrambling to ""figure out how to become the party of the 21st century American worker,"" Iacovella said. ""It boils down to, 'Voters think the China issue is important and we should be unapologetically pro-worker and anti-big business and anti-Wall St.'"" Such legislative priorities have long been pushed by Baldwin and Brown. Both will face tough re-election battles next year - Brown in Ohio, which Trump won with 53% of the vote in 2020, and Baldwin in Wisconsin, which voted by margins of less than 1% for Trump in 2016 and U.S. President Joe Biden in 2020. ""When we are using taxpayer dollars, we should be supporting U.S. jobs and small businesses,"" Baldwin said. ""Our previous president talked a lot about it, but wasn't successful in getting those provisions through."" Buy America bills often run in to opposition from corporate-minded lawmakers and pro-business associations. John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said ""Buy America"" policies have ""serious limitations"" and impose rising costs for businesses without increasing production. But the tide among Democrats is turning against these arguments. ""People are seeing the mistakes we made as a country on China trade over the years,"" Brown told Reuters. ""Too many Democratic - really presidents in both parties, from Bush to Trump - were complicit. We lost far too many jobs."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.99"
4,2023-07-28,0.7722,"2023-07-28Taiwan returns to growth in Q2 on strong domestic demand, but exports weak|TAIPEI, July 28 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export-dependent economy returned to growth in the second quarter, helped by resilient domestic consumption, while exports remained weak as a result of flagging demand for the island's technology products amid global headwinds. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a preliminary 1.45% in the April-June period versus a year earlier, the statistics agency said on Friday, beating the 0.8% growth forecast in a Reuters poll. Quarter-on-quarter, the economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.02%. GDP in the first quarter had fallen 2.87% from a year earlier, with the economy slipping into recession. Analysts attributed the recovery from a technical recession to a domestic economic rebound, while factors beyond Taiwan's shores continue to jeopardise the island's prospects. ""Looking forward to Q3, we expect domestic private sector consumption to return to normal levels...about 1.5%-2% growth,"" said Chengyu Liu of First Capital Management. ""Export demand remains weak. Taiwan's central bank will not raise interest rates"" at its next meeting in September, he said, adding that 2023 GDP growth would remain below 2%. Taiwan's exports fell more than expected in June, slumping the most in nearly 14 years, with the government predicting that a return to growth may not occur until November. Second-quarter exports dropped 16.9% compared with the same period last year, still slightly better than the first quarter's annual contraction of 19.2%. The government said in May it expects full-year 2023 growth of 2.04%, the slowest pace in nearly eight years and lower than 2.45% growth in 2022. The economy in China, Taiwan's largest export market, grew 6.3% in the second quarter, coming in under analyst forecasts, as demand weakened at home and abroad, with post-COVID momentum faltering rapidly. Taiwan is a key hub in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW), .

5,2023-07-28,0.9081,"2023-07-28TSMC says it is ""rooted in Taiwan"" even as it expands abroad|HSINCHU, Taiwan, July 28 (Reuters) - TSMC (2330.TW) will remain ""rooted in Taiwan"", its chief executive said on Friday in a bid to allay concerns that the world's largest contract chipmaker could abandon its island home as it expands abroad. CEO C.C. Wei was speaking at the opening of a massive research and development facility that TSMC, Asia's most valuable listed company and a key Apple Inc and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) supplier, built in Taiwan's tech hub Hsinchu. ""We want to use this opportunity to tell all the people of Taiwan that TSMC is determined to remain rooted in Taiwan,"" Wei said. ""Recently, to respond to customer requests, we have been building a lot of production lines around the world,"" he said. ""But we've also heard deeply concerned voices asking if TSMC has already moved its core abroad."" While the company makes the bulk of its chips in Taiwan, it has committed $40 billion to building a chip factory in the U.S. state of Arizona. It is also building one in Japan and considering a second one there, and is in talks with officials in Germany about building a plant there. TSMC's overseas expansions have sparked concerns in Taiwan, where chip manufacturing is the backbone of the economy, about a ""goodbye to Taiwan"" trend amid heightened tension with China and as other countries dangle incentives to attract chipmakers. China has in recent years increased diplomatic and military pressure against Taiwan, raising concerns about the fate of the factories that dot its western coast and produce the majority of the world's most advanced chips. Beijing views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a claim the government in Taipei rejects. The new home for TSMC's R&D efforts - with floor space spanning the equivalent of 42 soccer fields - will by September house more than 7,000 staff, including the researchers developing its most advanced technology as well as scholars working on exploratory research, the company said. The company broke ground on the facility in 2020. In 2022, TSMC ploughed T$162.2 billion ($5.16 billion) into R&D, up 30.1% from the previous year.

6,2023-07-28,0.9963,"2023-07-28Dow Jones index set to end 13 day winning streak|July 27 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was on the verge of ending its longest winning streak in 36 years on Thursday, successive gains showing that Wall Street's tech-driven rally is broadening to include a wider chunk of the stock market. The Dow closed higher for 13 straight sessions through Wednesday, its longest series of positive closes since 1987, and was last down 0.5% on Thursday afternoon after gaining earlier in the session. While the S&P 500 (.SPX), which includes over 500 stocks, is many investment professionals' preferred stock market benchmark, the Dow's daily moves are widely quoted in news media, making it widely recognized by many Americans. Its recent rally comes as traders widely believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday was the last in its campaign to control inflation. Investors are also optimistic the U.S. economy will avoid a recession. The Dow's longest-ever winning streak was 14 sessions, set in 1897, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Even after its recent gains, the Dow has lagged Wall Street's other main indexes in 2023. It is up 7% year to date, compared to a 18% gain in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq's (.IXIC) 35% surge. ""The Dow has been the laggard of the big three, and now it seems to be playing catch up. I think that catch-up trade is bringing us to a healthier place,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. The Dow's 30 constituents do not include market heavyweights Tesla (TSLA.O), Meta Platforms (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) or Amazon (AMZN.O), major winners in a stock market rally this year fueled by optimism about artificial intelligence and an eventual end to the Fed's rate hikes. ""We are actually seeing the market broaden out, so it's not just about seven artificial intelligence anointed darlings,"" Hogan added. Dow components Salesforce (CRM.N), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have rallied between 40% and 70% this year, making them the Dow's top performers. But the Dow has also been held back by declines of 10% or more in Amgen (AMGN.O), Chevron (CVX.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA.O). Overall, nearly half of Dow constituents remain down in 2023, even after outperforming so far in July. While the Dow's recent winning streak is unusually long, its overall strength has not been exceptional. The index climbed 4.8% since July 7, compared to 3.1% increase in the Nasdaq and a 3.4% rise in the S&P 500. The Dow's last 13-day winning streak in January 1987 produced a gain of 11.1%.

Epic, maker of the popular video game ""Fortnite,"" filed a request asking the nation's highest court to lift a July 17 decision by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to pause its ruling that upheld an injunction against Apple. The decision gave Apple 90 days to pursue an appeal at the Supreme Court. In the closely-watched case, Epic filed its antitrust lawsuit in 2020 challenging Apple's App Store practices. The 9th Circuit in April upheld a federal judge's 2021 order that could require Apple to allow developers to provide links and buttons that direct consumers to payment options outside the App Store and avoid paying sales commissions to Apple. The trial judge had found that Apple violated California's unfair competition laws by barring developers from ""steering"" users to other ways to pay, but also that Apple's rules did not violate antitrust laws. In seeking to pause the injunction from taking effect while it readies an appeal to the Supreme Court, Apple told the 9th Circuit that the trial judge had erred in prohibiting Apple from enforcing its rules against all app developers in the United States, rather than just Epic itself. ""Apple will be required to change its business model to comply with the injunction before judicial review has been completed,"" the company told the 9th Circuit. ""The undisputed evidence establishes that the injunction will limit Apple’s ability to protect users from fraud, scams, malware, spyware, and objectionable content."" Epic told the Supreme Court on Thursday that the 9th Circuit's standard for putting cases on hold is ""far too lenient."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9231"
8,2023-07-27,-0.128,"2023-07-27Ukraine's sappers advance slowly through Russian minefields|ZAPORIZHZHIA REGION, Ukraine, July 27 (Reuters) - Sappers fresh from the front conducted mine clearance drills in southeastern Ukraine this week, a task that is proving crucial but painstakingly slow as Ukrainian troops try to advance on Russian forces. As they trained on Wednesday, the sappers outlined the challenges they faced on the battlefield, offering an insight into why the counteroffensive has so far progressed slowly. Tasked with clearing tens of thousands of Russian mines, the sappers have to worry about booby traps, bombs and mortar attacks. Using a metal detector is often futile because of the amount of shrapnel from unexploded ordnance strewn around. ""They (the mines) are stalling the speed of the advance as we have to work very carefully,"" said Oleksandr, one of scores of sappers training at a location in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia that Kyiv's military told Reuters not to disclose. Oleksandr, who uses the call sign Agronomist, said NATO standards allowed for one person to advance seven square metres within four hours. ""Can you imagine that? However, that's not the case here."" he said. Ukraine has recaptured a string of villages but no big towns since launching its counteroffensive in the Russian-occupied south and east in early June. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has acknowledged progress has been slower than desired. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Ukrainian attacks in the south had intensified. Hours earlier, Zelenskiy had touted ""very good results"" from the front, without providing details. Before the counteroffensive began, Russian occupying forces on the southern front had time to dig trenches and put down ""dragon's teeth"" barricades, anti-tank ditches and mines. At the training drills, a 37-year-old soldier with the call sign ""Adam's Apple"" wore special foreign-made blast boots for mine clearance. ""I don't know which country manufactured them, but they are critically important for sappers because if one steps onto an anti-personnel landmine ... the boots will save the sapper's legs,"" he said. He said he sometimes has to use a stick to probe for mines, advancing slowly when there is so much shrapnel on the ground that using a mine detector is useless. Before the probing begins, he said, sappers must survey the area while standing, lying down and kneeling. ""The perspective differs, depending on the height,"" he said. ""If there are no booby traps, the sapper will examine the soil around his feet with the mine probe. If no mine is detected, he will move forward while keeping probing the soil.""

Chipmakers have been reporting sluggish demand, with rival Texas Instruments (TXN.O) saying earlier this week that some clients were cancelling orders, while Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) said last week that even booming AI chips had not offset broader market weakness. ""You know that smartphones this year overall will decrease,"" STM's Chief Executive Jean-Marc Chery said in a call with analysts. ""The inventory correction in personal electronics is going on, will still continue in Q3 as well."" The company expects third-quarter net revenue of $4.38 billion, up 1.2% from a year earlier, which JPMorgan analysts said was slightly above consensus estimates. However, the brokerage noted end-quarter inventories were 20.7% above the three-year seasonal average. STM's shares were up around 4% as of 0944 GMT, after they fell 3.5% initially. Automakers' push to make electric vehicles and develop driving assistance technology have eased challenges in the semiconductor sector also grappling with U.S.-China trade spats. STM, whose clients include Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O), credited automotive demand for the 12.7% rise in its second-quarter net revenue to $4.33 billion, slightly above analysts' consensus based on Refinitiv Eikon data. ""We will build more capacity for our European and global customers in advanced technologies and their transition to digitalisation and decarbonisation,"" Chery said. STM and Global Foundries (GFS.O) are investing some 7.5 billion euros ($8.35 billion), including French state aid, to build a major chip factory in Crolles, southeastern France. The group also sharpened its full-year outlook, expecting revenue of $17.4 billion, give or take $150 million, against its April guidance range of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion.

Third-party data shows the world's largest smartphone maker is making small gains in its single-digit market share in China, said TM Roh, head of mobile experience at Samsung Electronics. ""We are making efforts to reach Chinese consumers with products that fit the China market, through software optimisation that fits the China market, and I think the results are coming out little by little,"" Roh told reporters this week. Roh said Samsung's mobile business set the goal of ""recovering"" the China market via premium products and services like its new flagship foldable phones Samsung launched on Wednesday, as well as strengthening partnerships with local content firms. Samsung, which was the biggest smartphone vendor in China in 2013 with about a 20% market share, saw that plummet to 1% in 2018 then dip further below, overshadowed by Apple (AAPL.O) and Chinese vendors like Vivo, Oppo and Honor. But by March, Samsung had recovered a 1.1% market share, according to Counterpoint data. The current trend of premium smartphone demand outpacing demand for more bare-bones models is likely to continue for some time, Roh said, as ""mobile users' device replacement cycles are getting longer and longer in the global market."" ""I think they now decide buying the right product and using it longer is much more satisfactory and advantageous to their experience than replacing quickly with a new product."" As for the foldable phones Samsung pioneered in 2019, Roh said Samsung was working toward a lower-priced foldable model to widen its customer base, including in China and India.

The 26-year-old office worker, from the western prefecture of Hyogo, is one of scores of consumers across the world who have taken an interest in entomophagy, or eating insects, as bugs slowly become a more viable food source. As a child, Yamamoto said he sometimes snacked on soy-sauce basted grasshoppers. In Tokyo, he indulged in insect cuisine at Take-Noko cafe, which embraces all things buggy. ""It's fun to select from a wider variety of dishes,"" Yamamoto said at the cozy second-floor cafe, surrounded by insect art and terrariums of skittering beetles, ants and cockroaches. ""Everything was tasty. In particular, the water bug cider was quite refreshing and delicious, like a green apple."" Entomophagy started to be taken seriously globally after the United Nations deemed bugs a sustainable source of protein to feed a global population estimated to swell to 9.7 billion by 2050. The impact of the livestock industry on climate change, coupled with global food security issues due to extreme weather and conflicts, have also increased the interest in the high-quality, economical nutrition that bugs provide. While some consumers think eating insects is just gross, Japan has a rich culinary history of insects as food. [1/5]Almond tofu with beetle larvae is pictured at Take-Noko cafe in Tokyo, Japan, July 21, 2023. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Grasshoppers, silkworms, and wasps were traditionally eaten in land-locked regions where meat and fish are scarce, a practice that picked up amid food shortages during and after World War II, said Take-Noko manager Michiko Miura. ""Recently, there have been advances in rearing things like crickets and mealworms for food, so the possibility of using insects as ingredients is really growing,"" she added. Several companies, including national bakery brand Pasco, have sold made cakes and snacks from cricket flour, and processed food maker Nichirei and telecom Nippon Telegraph and Telephone have invested in bug ventures in the past year. The term ""crickets"" also started to trend in Japanese media recently after reports the powdered insects were being used in school lunches and snacks. Consumer interest has also extended to Take-Noko, which manager Miura says is often fully booked on weekends. Its curry is studded crickets in meatball form and dried garnish. The delicate ""sashimi"" is the left-over casing of silkworms, and the cider is infused with water bug extract and topped with a whole insect, said to taste like shrimp. The restaurant is the brainchild of Takeo Saito who founded his namesake company Takeo Inc nine years ago and has grown it to include packaged food business offering more than 60 types of arthropod treats, from scorpions to tarantulas.

The platforms are appealing a 2022 ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Davila of San Jose, California, that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which immunizes online publishers for hosting third-party content, does not shield the sites from claims that they essentially acted as “bookies” by facilitating (and collecting a commission on) purchases of virtual chips for use in online casino games. The trial judge said that those payment processing claims, asserted in more than a dozen statewide class actions on behalf of casino app users from states with stringent gambling laws, fall outside of Section 230’s immunity for online publishers because they involved allegedly unlawful acts by the platforms themselves. Davila did dismiss plaintiffs' claims that Apple (AAPL.O) , Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Meta (META.O) were liable for offering access to the casino apps and providing the app developers with data and other services to help them target big spenders and retain users. The judge, as I told you last year, acknowledged that “reasonable minds” might reach different conclusions about the scope of the platforms' immunity under Section 230 in the context of casino apps. The judge, of his own accord, certified his order for interlocutory appeal. Both sides took him up on that offer. Apple, Meta and Google appealed Davila’s decision that they can be liable for processing virtual chip payments. Plaintiffs' lawyers from law firm Edelson brought cross-appeals over their dismissed claims. The platforms’ newly filed briefs are the first salvos in an appellate briefing process that won’t wrap up until December. Apple, Meta and Google each filed its own brief, so the appeals are not identical. (Google, for instance, opted not to use the word ""bookie."") But all of the filings assert the same basic arguments: Davila wrongly interpreted 9th Circuit precedent from HomeAway.com Inc v. City of Santa Monica – and unless the 9th Circuit overturns his decision, the consequences could be dire. At worst, the platforms said, every website that offers in-app purchases – including sites like Spotify and Substack, which sell subscriptions – could be exposed to liability whenever a plaintiff claims an injury from an unlawful product. Apple’s lawyers at Weil, Gotshal & Manges said the theory proffered by the casino apps plaintiffs for circumventing Section 230 immunity is ""limitless."" Meta counsel from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe echoed that argument, warning the 9th Circuit that “clever lawyers” will find ways to use Davila’s reasoning to recast claims that would be precluded under Section 230. “Plaintiffs’ wordplay of isolating the transaction from the content itself would offer an easy end-run around this court’s existing decisions applying Section 230, none of which makes protection turn on whether the service received compensation in connection with the purchase of challenged third-party content,” Meta said. The platforms argued that because different countries, states and geographical regions have different laws, Davila’s reasoning would force them to engage in intensive monitoring of apps and individual users to avert claims that they facilitated illegal conduct by processing payments. Platforms would even need to check on users’ geographic location as they interacted with particular apps, Apple said. “That goes far beyond monitoring,” the Apple brief asserted. “That would be Orwellian.” It's also not what Congress intended when it passed Section 230 to protect online publishers, the platforms said. Davila’s mistake, they argued, was in failing to treat the platforms as publishers when they processed casino app users' payments for virtual casino chips. The platforms, explained Google's lawyers at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, did not create the chips sold by the allegedly illegal casino apps. Nor did they create the apps that encourage users to buy the virtual chips. Google merely offered the casino apps the same payment processing services its provides as a publisher, the brief said, so it’s impossible to divorce payment processing from the hosting activity Davila found to be immunized under Section 230. That distinguishes the online gambling case from the conduct at issue in the HomeAway case that Davila relied upon, according to the platforms. The 9th Circuit ruled in that case that Section 230 did not pre-empt a Santa Monica law barring websites from accepting booking fees for certain short-term housing rentals. The sites had argued that the city law would contravene Section 230 by requiring them to monitor online content to be sure they did not offer illegal rentals. The 9th Circuit rejected that contention, concluding that the prohibition addressed the booking, not the online listings. In the casino app cases, argued Apple, Meta and Google in their 9th Circuit briefs, the platforms have no independent duty, outside of their role as a publisher, to refuse to process in-app payments. Their purportedly illegal conduct, they said, is based entirely on the nature of the casino apps and the virtual chips they sell – a critical difference between HomeAway and the casino cases. “In HomeAway, the claims did not turn at all on the nature of the third-party content (the online rental listings); whereas here, the claims turn entirely on the nature of the casino-themed video games and virtual chips,” Meta asserted. “That distinction is dispositive under Section 230.” I reached out to plaintiffs' lawyers Rafey Balabanian and Jay Edelson of Edelson for comment on the platforms’ brief. They didn’t respond. Edelson has collected hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements with casino app developers, including a $415 million class settlement approved in June. Apple, Meta, Google and their lawyers also did not respond to queries. As I mentioned, there will be a lot more action to come in these appeals and counterappeals at the 9th Circuit. But this week’s initial foray proves, if you will excuse the pun, that the stakes in these casino app cases are sky-high.

Microsoft's (MSFT.O) shares fell 3.6% in early trading as the company laid out an aggressive AI-related spending plan, saying deeper investments in AI are required before gains trickle to the bottom line. Microsoft is set to shed about $100 billion from its market capitalization if the loses hold until close of trading. Its shares had gained 46.4% up to yesterday's close. ""AI will generate a lot of revenue and earnings for such firms, but a lot of investors have been buying the rumor and now that we have earnings, they are taking profits,"" Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist for Murphy & Sylvest said. ""There's still a lot of excitement around AI, but nobody quite understands what that means for the bottom line of many of these companies."" The NYSE FANG+ index (.NYFANG), which houses many megacap growth names, was down 0.2%. The index has risen about 76% so far this year, driven by the frenzy around AI. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) was an outlier. Its shares rose 5.6% after the company beat expectations for second-quarter results. Alphabet looks set to add about $100 billion to its market capitalization. The recent rally has driven up Microsoft's valuation. The stock is trading at 31 times 12-month forward earnings, compared to a PE multiple of 20 for Alphabet. ""The tech earnings season has started on a mixed note,"" said Mark Haefele, global wealth management chief investment officer at UBS in a client note. ""The tone set by quarterly results over the next week will be crucial to the performance of tech stocks through the rest of the third quarter."" Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the world's most valuable publicly listed company, and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are set to report quarterly earnings next week. FED FEARS vs. AI BOOST Investors also remained cautious on Wednesday, with Wall Street's main indexes muted ahead of a likely Federal Reserve interest rate hike later in the day that could push borrowing costs to their highest since the global financial crisis. Large tech companies, which rely heavily on borrowed money, have been pressured since the Fed started its tightening cycle to tame inflation. However, optimism over AI and hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle have supported tech stocks in recent months. Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital, said tech stocks tend to be fairly exposed to such sentiment around central bank policy as many of them are reliant on robust economic growth to deliver the returns they promise. ""There are valid concerns that the U.S. economy is weakening, but until the Fed sees sustained evidence of softening inflationary pressures, the hawkish stance will be maintained, even at the risk of tipping the economy into negative growth."" Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) shares rose 1.0% after Alibaba's (9988.HK) cloud computing division said it has become the first Chinese enterprise to support the company's open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model Llama. Amazon shares dropped 1.3% after a media report said the Federal Trade Commission is finalizing an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shares tumbled 18.3% after the photo messaging app-owner reported a weaker third-quarter forecast than analysts had expected on Tuesday. ""Band-Aids not fixing bullet holes yet,"" wrote Bernstein stock analyst, Mark Shmulik. The company's Snapchat app has added a new AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions to attract more users, but Shmulik notes the company has struggled to consistently grow revenue and catch up to rivals like Facebook-owner Meta. ""Snapchat is running to stay in the same place while peers enviously get back on the ad growth track,"" Shmulik said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The world's largest smartphone maker pioneered the segment in 2019, betting that it would appeal to consumers looking for a bigger screen to consume content, while its foldable displays keep the overall phone size compact. Foldable phones remain a niche product category, carving out 5% of the global premium smartphone market, although the sector has grown rapidly from just 0.3% in 2019, according to research firm Counterpoint. Samsung, a leader in the segment with 63% market share in the first quarter, is looking to accelerate the growth trajectory with an aggressive pricing plan and faster rollout, industry analysts said. The company on Wednesday priced its new clamshell Galaxy Z Flip5 at $999.99, and the wide Galaxy Z Fold5 to start at $1,799.99 in the United States, the same as the launch prices of the last two years' models. It made the folded Flip5 thinner than last year's model by improving the hinge - and enlarged the cover screen to 3.4 inches (8.64 cm), adding more capacity for interactions and an improved ability to take a selfie with the top-line main camera. Samsung's 7.6-inch screen Fold5, lighter and thinner than last year's model, offers a bigger vapour chamber for better heat management when gaming or multitasking and a 41% thinner stylus. Both models use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipsets. The unveiling of the latest models comes weeks earlier than last year - seen by analysts as a bid to keep the limelight for longer before the next iPhone release. ""Competition with Apple's iPhone 15 series is inevitable. Consumers of foldable products are expanding from early adopters to general users, in particular... in China and Western Europe,"" said Jene Park, senior analyst at Counterpoint. Because of advanced technology used for foldable displays and hinges, foldable phones are ""significantly more expensive than general smartphones"" to make, which can make price the biggest obstacle for a consumer, Park said. In 2023, global foldable smartphone shipments are projected to reach 19 million units, up about 45% from 13.1 million in 2022, according to Counterpoint. Apple had a 75% share of the premium smartphone market priced $600 or above in 2022, versus Samsung's 16%. Samsung's new foldable phones will be available from Aug. 11 in select markets.

17,2023-07-26,-0.9698,"2023-07-26LG Display flags Q4 turnaround after 5th straight quarterly loss|SEOUL, July 26 (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display (034220.KS) reported a fifth consecutive quarterly loss on Wednesday but forecast a return to profit in the last quarter of the current year, driven by an expansion of mobile panel shipments and other made-to-order business. LG Display expects ""a rise in demand for panels"" as stockpiles of display panels have fallen during the first half of the year, CFO Sung-hyun Kim said. ""It appears that the market is now over the worst, but not yet starting a full recovery backed by actual demand,"" Kim told an earnings call, adding that a turnaround was expected in the fourth quarter. The Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier posted an 881 billion won ($689 million) operating loss for the April-June quarter versus a 488 billion won loss in the year-ago quarter, as weak seasonal demand for mobile display panels was compounded by sustained weakness in premium TV demand in its key market Europe. The second-quarter result was in line with a forecast of an 889 billion won loss from 16 analysts polled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate, weighted toward analysts that are more consistently accurate. It had reduced losses from the first quarter's 1.1 trillion won. Revenue fell 15% from the year-earlier period to 4.7 trillion won. LG Display shares fell 2.7% in afternoon trade, versus a 1.7% drop in the wider market (.KS11). Factory run-rates for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays used in high-end televisions remained relatively low due to weak sales in Europe, resulting in the poor performance in the second quarter, analysts said. The company has been running its OLED factory below full capacity due to a limited customer base and as a pandemic-driven demand surge for new TVs has tapered off. However, panel sales to Apple are set to increase for the iPhone maker's new smartphone launch later this year. Mobile display panel orders are concentrated in the second half of the year, ahead of the holiday season. LG Display will start supplying high-end TV panels to Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), Reuters reported in May. However, the initial supply volume is unlikely to significantly impact the company's financials in the third quarter, analysts said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|-0.9698"

The watchdog is concerned Apple might ""abuse its dominant position by implementing discriminatory, non-objective and non-transparent conditions for the use of user data for advertising purposes"", it said in a statement. The statement triggers an antitrust procedure during which the company will be able to express its point of view, the watchdog said. Apple denied the allegation. The mechanism ""gives users more control by requiring all apps to ask permission before tracking them"", the company said in an e-mailed statement, adding it will ""continue to engage constructively"" with the French regulator. Four French online advertising industry groups filed an antitrust complaint in 2020 against Apple over changes the company made to privacy features when it started to ask iPhone owners whether they were ready to allow apps to gather data used to define and send targeted ads, called App Tracking Transparency (ATT). The feature lead to revenue declines for publishers, industry lobby groups said. The four associations - IAB France, MMAF, SRI and UDECAM - said the changes brought by Apple did not meet European Union privacy rules, citing the fact that while the opt-in mechanism applied for third-party developers, Apple's own apps did not include it. ""Apple’s apps do not show an ATT prompt because they do not track, meaning they do not link user or device data with user or device data collected from other companies’ apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, nor do they share user or device data with data brokers,"" Apple said. ""Apple holds its advertising business to a higher standard of privacy than it requires of any other developer,"" the company added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.1531"

Netherlands-based NXP makes a near-field communications chip that goes into smartphones to help with mobile payments and other functions. Sievers did not discuss Apple Inc (AAPL.O) by name, but analysts believe the iPhone maker is a major customer. Sievers' comments in an interview with Reuters came a day after the company gave a better-than-expected sales forecast based on a steady recovery in the automotive segment, sending its shares up 4.8% to $221.05 by midday Tuesday. China's smartphone market has suffered as the country's growth has slowed, with Counterpoint Research reporting that sales declined 8% for the early June ""618"" shopping season in the country. But Apple has resisted the trend, with sales rising 8% during the shopping period, Counterpoint said. NXP's forecast suggests that Apple's strength may continue. In an interview, Sievers said NXP expects mobile revenue to increase 23% in the current third quarter, up from $284 million in the just-ended second quarter. While the Android portion of those mobile chip orders is growing slightly, Sievers said there is no rebound in sight. ""I would still say the (smartphone) build rates are below what they used to be in China. And we also don't see it jumping,"" he said. Sievers said most of the 23% increase forecast for mobile chip sales is attributable to a large customer that NXP cannot name. Most analysts believe that company is Apple. ""This increase in itself sequentially from Q2 to Q3 is quite good,"" Sievers said. ""We also compare that seasonally to past years or to more normal years.

Corning said it expects core sales of about $3.5 billion in the three months ending September, compared with analysts' estimates of $3.70 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. Shares of Corning, whose Gorilla glass for smartphones is used by companies such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), were down nearly 1.5% before the bell. The company has seen a drop in demand from its consumer electronics clients as smartphone makers try to clear a build-up of inventory caused by high inflation and rising interest rates. Corning has moved aggressively this year to cut down on costs to make up for the slump in its main markets, which, combined with earlier price hikes, has helped the company to still expand its core gross margin by 100 basis points to 36.2%. ""We expect to continue improving profitability and cash flow despite our relatively muted sales environment,"" said CEO Wendell Weeks. In the second quarter, core sales fell 7.4% year-on-year to $3.48 billion, in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv, but have risen 3% from the previous quarter in a likely sign the slump in client spending may be starting to ease. Revenue from the optical communications unit - Corning's biggest - fell 19% from a year earlier, hit by weak demand for its optical fiber cables used in telecommunications business. The specialty materials business, home to Gorilla Glass, posted a 13% fall in revenue, but that was somewhat cushioned by a jump in sales at the display technologies unit. Corning posted an adjusted profit of 45 cents per share, just short of the 46 cents estimated by analysts. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.886"

28,2023-07-24,-0.9601,"2023-07-24India to face apple crunch as heavy rain hits production|NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR, July 24 (Reuters) - India's apple production is expected to nearly halve this year after heavy rains and flash floods wiped out about $122 million worth of fruit in the main producing Himalayan region, officials and farmer unions said. The mountainous Kashmir territory and Himachal Pradesh produce nearly all of India's apples, which are largely consumed domestically. Less than 2% of the country's apples are exported, mostly to Bangladesh and Nepal. Heavy rains have not only damaged farms, but also destroyed roads, power lines and infrastructure worth $550 million in Himachal Pradesh, while bad weather at the same time has hit India's crucial rice crop, which led to an export ban last week. Fruits including apples have been left rotting in farms after a fungus infestation, according to farmer unions. ""About 10% of Himachal's apple orchards have been washed away, which is a major loss as it takes around 15 years for the tree to give fruit,"" said Harish Chauhan, the state convener of farmers union Samyukta Kisan Manch. The Apple Growers Association of India and Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers estimate output in Kashmir, the largest apple grower in the country, will drop 50% this year from 1.87 million metric tons a year ago. ""Crops are mainly affected because it did not snow as much as it should have this winter and excessive rains later damaged farms,"" the Apple Growers Association's president Ravinder Chauhan said. Kashmir has received 50% more rain than average so far this monsoon, which began on June 1, while Himachal state, the second-largest producer, has recorded 79% more rain than normal, data from the weather department showed. Kashmir's horticulture department estimates overall damage to fruit crops of up to $109.78 million. In Himachal state, output is expected to drop 40% from output of 640,000 metric tons last year, a state official said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|-0.9601"
29,2023-07-21,0.9938,"2023-07-21Global shares slip, dollar soars versus yen on Bank of Japan policy expectations|NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Global share markets edged lower on Friday as most U.S. megacap stocks slipped, while the dollar soared against the yen after Reuters reported the Bank of Japan is leaning toward keeping its dovish monetary policy next week. Gold prices fell as the dollar rebounded to its highest in more than a week as investors prepare for next week's big central bank policy meetings, including the BOJ, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The yen weakened 1.16% to 141.74 per dollar, while the dollar index , a measure of the greenback against major trading currencies, rose 0.29%. The Dow eked out a gain to extend its winning streak to 10 sessions. But the Nasdaq fell and the S&P 500 barely rose, signs that the megacap tech and growth stocks that have driven the two indices respective 34% and 18% advances this year have stalled. Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston, said ""you've seen a broadening out in the rally coming off narrow leadership,"" a reference to megacaps such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc . More investors are now embracing the probability of a soft landing, with many companies well financed at lower interest rates so that higher rates - the Fed's terminal rate is expected to rise to 5.25%-5.5% next week - will not cause a credit crunch as in the past. ""This is an income-driven cycle as opposed to a credit cycle,"" said Melson. ""Real incomes are growing as inflation cools and corporate and household balance sheets are very, very robust and have excess cash,"" he said. ""Bottom line, the odds for a soft landing are very strong."" The Dow (.DJI) rose 0.01%, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) slid 0.22%. ""The mood across equity markets is unequivocally that the worst is behind us,"" said Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy and asset allocation at SLC Management in Boston, though the Fed's credit tightening is creating cracks. ""None of them are happening with massive severity, but the longer we go on with higher rates, more and more that's going to come through,"" he said. ""But again, big picture pretty good, but there are cracks."" A special rebalancing of the Nasdaq 100 (.NDX) that takes effect before Monday's opening may cause ""quirky price action"" in tech mega-caps, said Patrick Spencer, vice chair of equities at Baird in London. The overhaul of the index to reduce its heavy weightings of the super megacaps, such as Microsoft and Apple, may exacerbate moves in these stocks during the ongoing earnings season, he said. MSCI's U.S.-centric gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) closed down 0.2%, and the NYSE FANG+TM index (.NYFANG), which includes the megacap stocks, slid 0.97%. In Europe, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) rose 0.32% to end the week higher as declining tech stocks were offset by gains in energy companies that tracked oil prices higher. BOJ policymakers prefer to scrutinize more data to ensure wages and inflation keep rising before changing yield control policy, five sources familiar with the matter said. The report added there was no consensus within the central bank and the decision could still be a close call. As Japanese inflation has stayed above the BOJ's target, traders have bet on the central bank ditching its yield curve control program, a move likely to cause the yen to strengthen. ""Markets were building up expectations which now look unlikely to play out,"" said Guillaume Paillat, a multi-asset manager at Aviva Investors. Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield fell 5 bps to 0.41%, the lowest level since July 6, right before speculation for a hawkish tweak to policy this month began to ramp up. The bond posted its biggest one-day fall since April. In U.S. bond markets, Treasury yields mostly eased after spending Thursday braced for further Fed hawkishness in response to an unexpected drop in weekly unemployment claims. The two-year Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 0.7 basis points at 4.846%, while the benchmark 10-year yield fell 1.7 basis points to 3.837%. Oil prices edged higher, buoyed by evidence of tightening supplies and economic stimulus in slow-recovering China. U.S. crude rose $1.42 to settle at $77.07 a barrel and Brent settled up $1.43 at $81.07. U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower at $1,966.60 an ounce.
