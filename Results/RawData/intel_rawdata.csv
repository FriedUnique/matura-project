0,2023-07-28,0.9949,"2023-07-28Wall Street eyes higher open after inflation data|July 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open higher on Friday after data showing easing inflation pressures added to hopes that the Federal Reserve's policy tightening was ending, while chip stocks surged as Intel posted a surprise quarterly profit. U.S. annual inflation slowed considerably in June, likely pushing the Federal Reserve closer to ending its fastest interest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s. In the 12 months through June, the PCE price index advanced 3.0%. That was the smallest annual gain since March 2021 and followed a 3.8% rise in May. ""With inflation going in the right direction, this should give some breathing room for the stocks to refocus on earnings, which continue to outpace expectations,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. Market expectations of another 25 basis point rate hike in November were largely unchanged at 29.9% after the data. IRPR Chipmaker Intel's (INTC.O) results and forecast pointed to an improving PC market, sending its shares up 6.2% in premarket trading. Peers Nvidia (NVDA.O), Micron Technology (MU.O) and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O) gained over 1% each. Global stock markets eased following Japan's tweaks to its monetary policy. The Dow snapped its longest winning streak since 1987 in the previous session as U.S. Treasury yields pressured stocks lower after news that the Bank of Japan will allow long-term interest rates to rise. On Friday, the Bank of Japan made its yield curve control policy more flexible and loosened its defense of a long-term interest rate cap, in moves seen by investors as a prelude to an eventual shift away from massive monetary stimulus. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note slipped, but still hovered close to its 4% level hit in the previous session. All three major U.S. indexes are on track to end the week marginally higher, supported by Big Tech earnings, hopes that the Fed's monetary policy tightening was ending and the world's largest economy was heading for a soft landing. At 8:40 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 163 points, or 0.46%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 30.75 points, or 0.67%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 171.5 points, or 1.1%. Ford Motor (F.N) slid 1.7% after Chief Executive Jim Farley outlined a change in the automaker's product strategy, slowing the ramp-up of money-losing EVs, shifting investment to its commercial vehicle unit and citing plans to quadruple sales of gas electric hybrids over the next five years. First Solar (FSLR.O) jumped 11.5% after its second-quarter earnings beat estimates and the company announced plans to spend up to $1.1 billion on its fifth U.S. factory. Enphase Energy (ENPH.O) fell 14.6% after the solar inverter maker's third-quarter revenue forecast missed expectations, Juniper Networks(JNPR.N) tumbled 7.0% after the network operator forecast third-quarter revenue below market estimates.

1,2023-07-28,0.9801,"2023-07-28U.S. lawmakers urge Biden administration to tighten AI chip export rules|SAN FRANCISCO, July 28 (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers who head a committee focused on China on Friday urged the Biden administration to tighten export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips in the wake of industry lobbying to leave the rules unchanged. Representative Mike Gallagher, a Republican and chair of the House of Representatives select committee on China, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat and ranking member of the committee, in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo called to ""further strengthen"" a sweeping set of export control rules implemented last October that cut off China's access to top AI chips made by U.S. firms such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Intel (INTC.O). The letter urges U.S. officials to take an even stricter approach than one Reuters reported last month that they are considering. The October 2022 rules impose two performance caps on exporting AI chips to China - one on how fast the chips can talk to one another, and the second on the chips' processing speeds. After the rules took effect, Nvidia created special chips for China with lower interconnect speeds. Intel this month also said it has created an AI chip that can be sold in China. But Nvidia's chips still have high enough processing speeds to be useful in creating AI systems, and Reuters reported in May that the U.S. export controls have done little to slow the progress of China's AI sector. Last month, Reuters reported that U.S. officials were considering tightening the rules by focusing on processing speeds alone, which could affect Nvidia's chips. Nvidia at the time said that restricting sales of its AI chips to China ""would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for the U.S. industry."" The potential tightening of the rules set off a flurry of lobbying activity, with the chief executives of Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm traveling to Washington last week to meet with administration officials to discuss China policy. The same day as the visit, the Semiconductor Industry Association, a U.S.-based industry group, urged the Biden administration to allow the ""the industry to have continued access to the China market, the worldâ€™s largest commercial market for commodity semiconductors."" On Friday, Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi urged an even tighter approach than the one Reuters previously reported officials are considering. The lawmakers' letter recommended keeping a speed limit on how fast chips can talk to one another and said it ""should be lowered sufficiently to prevent clever engineering that bypasses the regulations."" The lawmakers also urged administration officials to ""closely consider"" how to cut off Chinese firms' access to advanced computing chips in the cloud, where major U.S. firms such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google offer the chips for rent as part of their cloud computing services. ""We urge you to even further strengthen the October 7, 2022, rules so that advanced U.S. technology and expertise related to advanced computing and semiconductors are not used against the United States,"" Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi wrote.

2,2023-07-28,0.9517,"2023-07-28U.S. chipmaker AMD to invest $400 million in India by 2028|GANDHINAGAR, India, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) said on Friday it will invest around $400 million in India over the next five years and will build its largest design center in the tech hub of Bengaluru. AMD's announcement was made by its Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster at an annual semiconductor conference that started Friday in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat. Other speakers at the flagship event include Foxconn (2317.TW) Chairman Young Liu and Micron (MU.O) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Despite being a late entrant, the Modi government has been courting investments into India's nascent chip sector to establish its credentials as a chipmaking hub. AMD said it will open its new design centre campus in Bengaluru by end of this year and create 3,000 new engineering roles within five years. ""Our India teams will continue to play a pivotal role in delivering the high-performance and adaptive solutions that support AMD customers worldwide,"" Papermaster said. The new 500,000-square-foot (55,555 square yards) campus will increase AMD's office footprint in India to 10 locations. It already has more than 6,500 employees in the country. From personal computers to data centers, AMD chips are used in a wide range of devices. The Santa Clara, California-based firm is also working on an artificial intelligence chip that will take on market leader Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O). Unlike its top rival Intel, AMD outsources production of chips it designs to third-party manufacturers like Taiwan's TSMC. TSMC and the South Korea's Samsung are among the elite few chipmakers globally to have mastered cutting-edge chipmaking, a technology many nations are now vying for to avoid supply chain shocks, such as faced during the pandemic. India in 2021 unveiled a $10 billion incentive programme for the chip sector, but the plan has floundered as no company has so far managed to get clearance for setting up a fabrication plant, the centerpiece to Modi's ambitions. Other investments in India include a multi-year $400 million plan by U.S. chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT.O) in June to set up an engineering center, and chipmaker Micron' $825 million investment in a semiconductor testing and packaging unit in Gujarat.

3,2023-07-28,0.9896,"2023-07-28Intel results boost chip stocks on optimism PC market slump is ending|July 28 (Reuters) - Intel shares surged 7% on Friday, a day after the chipmaker's unexpectedly strong quarterly report heralded a turnaround in fortunes after a long, margin-sapping struggle due to plummeting PC sales and a highly competitive data center market. The company's surprise second-quarter profit and its strong earnings and margin forecasts suggested the personal computer market slump was nearing an end, sparking the surge in its stock (INTC.O) and the wider chip sector (.SOX). Intel is poised to add about $10 billion to its market value, based on its current premarket price of $37. That is already 6% higher than Wall Street's median target of $35 after at least 17 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock. ""Intel's turnaround is finally happening,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester. He also expects ""far better quarters ahead for Intel and most other chipmakers."" Intel's results lifted Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) by 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively, while Qualcomm (QCOM.O) rose 1.5%. A titan of the American chip industry, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as Taiwan's TMSC and Nvidia both in terms of margins and market value as the PC market downturn and stiff competition in the data center market battered its business. While Intel's shares have rallied 30% this year after a tough 2022, that has paled in comparison to the more than three-fold rise in Nvidia, which became the first chipmaker with a trillion-dollar market value in May after its own ""historic"" forecast. However, that was largely due to the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market, which Intel has missed out on because of its small presence in graphics-processing units and other AI specialist chips that enable the technology behind ChatGPT. Indeed, Intel's AI and data centers business contracted 15% in the recent quarter, and CEO Pat Gelsinger said a glut in the server central processing units (CPU) market will persist until the second half of the year. He added that Intel now has enough customer orders to sell at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips through 2024. Nonetheless, analysts at Rosenblatt Securities ""don't see AI as an investable theme for Intel currently."" Intel has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31.10, compared with Nvidia's 43.26 and an industry median of 19.95. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9896"
4,2023-07-28,0.979,"2023-07-28Morning Bid: Bank of Japan excites, Dow unlucky, Intel jumps|A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan The Bank of Japan added its own twist to a week of rising central bank interest rates on Friday, and it proved an unlucky 13 for Dow Jones bluechips (.DJI) on Wall St. The BOJ's long-awaited tweak of its ultra-easy bond-buying monetary policy caused as much confusion as shock, sending long-term Japanese government bond (JGB) yields about 13 basis points higher but weakening the yen against a pumped up dollar - after some wild initial swings. The Nikkei stock benchmark (.N225) fell back marginally. Specifically, the central bank said it would offer to buy 10-year JGBs at 1.0% in fixed-rate operations, instead of the previous rate of 0.5% - tolerating the wider band for bond market borrowing rates. But it seemed loth to indicate a major change of tack, preferring to characterise the move as a desire for more flexibility. With July core inflation in Tokyo falling back to a 10-month low, the need for tightening may be ebbing anyway. After a week in which the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank delivered quarter-point interest rate hikes - while signalling those could be the last of the cycle - the market mood remained relatively upbeat. As press speculation of the BOJ's policy tinkering seeped around markets late on Thursday, Treasury yields popped high and Wall St stocks pulled back - ending the Dow's hopes of a longest winning streak in more than a century. It settled for 13 straight gains through Wednesday instead - the most since 1987. The stock market stalling came after the ECB decision and an impressive array of U.S. economic updates that revealed an unexpected acceleration of U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter even as inflation gauges subsided - and another strong weekly reading of the jobs market. Friday's data is expected to show another drop in the Fed's favoured core PCE inflation gauge in June. Deep in the weeds of a forecast-beating corporate earnings season, shares in chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) surged 7% after the bell after the firm reported a surprise profit and third-quarter guidance well ahead of Wall St estimates. Chip stocks were lifted across the board. With ""Big Oil"" topping the earnings diary on Friday, some 78% of S&P500 firms have beaten estimates so far - giving an aggregate 6.8% drop in year-over-year profits and steady revenue. For markets more broadly, Friday seems a little scattergun so far after a heavy week of macro policy and corporate news. S&P500 futures were back higher ahead of the open, with European bourses down a touch and China's indexes outperforming in Asia. The VIX volatility gauge (.VIX) settled below 14 after some outsize swings on Thursday. U.S. Treasury yields fell back from two-week highs hit after the punchy U.S. economy readouts and central bank moves, with the 2-to-10 year yield curve steepening as recession fears abate. The dollar (.DXY) climbed to its highest level in more than a fortnight, with euro/dollar diving back under $1.10 on dovish ECB signals about the end of the rate rise campaign following its latest hike on Thursday.

5,2023-07-28,0.9748,"2023-07-28Japan's JSR says exit of foreign investors will free it to make deals|TOKYO, July 28 (Reuters) - JSR Corp (4185.T), which plans a $6.4 billion sale to a government-backed fund, says the deal to go private will free it from the difficulty of managing its large foreign investor base and make it easier to pursue deals in the chip materials sector. The announcement last month that JSR would be bought by Japan Investment Corp, which is overseen by the trade ministry, was met with surprise in the materials sector with some analysts and chip industry executives questioning the need for such an intervention or scope for meaningful industry change. Eric Johnson, the American-born CEO of JSR, a top manufacturer of photoresists used in chip making, said going private should ease concerns from possible partners about the risk of changes to the company's ownership or strategy. ""When we're 50% foreign owned that gives people pause within Japan,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""It's a burden for any public CEO and in the context of trying to drive strategic M&A within Japan, it's especially difficult."" While hardly a household name, JSR plays a leading role in the global semiconductor supply chain and is tied to defining issues for corporate Japan: efforts to strengthen its chip industry and the increasingly visible role foreign investors are playing across the world's No.3 economy. Johnson said he previously had ""high-level"" discussions with potential partners but believes the new ownership structure will open doors. ""We can enter into these partnering discussions with a much more stable foundation,"" Johnson said. JSR, a supplier to chipmakers such as TSMC , Samsung (005930.KS) and Intel (INTC.O), has investors including ValueAct Capital, which has a seat on the board. JSR management was frustrated by ValueAct intervening in company strategy and one motivation for the go-private deal was to exit the activist investor from its shareholder register, two people familiar with the matter said. Johnson said that was not the case. ""The board should challenge and try to drive me to make the best possible decisions for the company,"" Johnson said, emphasising he was not speaking about a specific board member. ""It's not true that I'm feeling particular pressure from a particular shareholder and therefore I want to jettison that pressure,"" he said. Companies often view the presence of an activist investor as a challenge to their strategy or a factor that could delay execution of their plans. ValueAct declined to comment. The activist investor previously praised JSR's ""fact-based decision making"" and said it supports the sale to JIC. Analysts have questioned how JSR will drive change in Japan's materials sector, which remains world beating even as the country has ceded dominance in chip manufacturing. ""There are many companies that are already competitive in the materials industry and it is difficult to see synergies through consolidation,"" said Atsushi Ikeda, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. ""However it would lead to cost reductions in areas such as pooling of development costs and inspection equipment,"" Ikeda said. Yuta Nishiyama, an analyst at Citigroup, said that if JSR can ""monopolise technological capabilities"" it would boost its competitiveness. ""But that doesn't contribute to the Japanese semiconductor materials industry overall,"" he said. JSR said there is scope for meaningful deals. ""I don't think they're being imaginative enough ... there's a wide range of materials expertise in Japan,"" Johnson said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9748"
6,2023-07-28,0.9432,"2023-07-28Chipmakers signal supply glut easing but demand recovery still slow|SEOUL, July 28 (Reuters) - From Intel (INTC.O) to Samsung (005930.KS), global chipmakers are celebrating the beginning of the end of a semiconductor supply glut, but the outlook for demand from customers outside the artificial intelligence (AI) industry remains gloomy. All the major markets for chips - smartphones, PCs and data centres - have shrunk this year, as both corporate customers and consumers scale back spending amid a weak global economy, high inflation and rising interest rates. This has created an unprecedented oversupply of commodity chips, causing a record combined 15.2 trillion won ($12 billion) first-half operating loss for the world's two largest memory chipmakers, Samsung and SK Hynix (000660.KS). This glut, however, has started to ease largely due to production cuts and as a decline in PC shipments eased to 11% in the June quarter compared to a 30% slump in each of the previous two quarters, data from tech analysts Canalys showed. The smartphone market is also improving, with cellphone shipments falling 8% in the June quarter, versus 14% in the first quarter, according to research firm Counterpoint. ""Demand is recovering very gradually,"" Woohyun Kim, chief financial officer at SK Hynix, said on an earnings call this week. ""The recent improvement in PC shipments has been mainly led by promotions and low-end models, meaning it provided limited impact on chip demand recovery,"" he said, adding that shipment forecasts for PCs and smartphones this year have been downgraded from earlier predictions. While demand for chips to support generative AI has rapidly increased since OpenAI's ChatGPT was launched late last year, the sector still accounts for a small fraction of overall chip demand and is crimping corporate spending on servers, as some companies prioritize investment in AI. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on Thursday an inventory glut in server central processing units (CPUs) will persist until the second half of the year and that data centre chip sales will decline modestly in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. A sluggish recovery in China, the world's biggest chip buyer, is also dampening the overall outlook. Both Samsung and SK Hynix said China's reopening failed to live up to expectations that it would revive the smartphone market, and that they were extending production cuts of NAND memory chips, widely used in smartphones to store digital data. Analog chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN.O), which has heavy exposure to China, forecast third-quarter revenue and profit below Wall Street targets on Tuesday, bogged down by a sluggish recovery in end-market demand that has forced clients to cancel orders. ""China was roughly half of sales at the end of fiscal 2022, so China has the largest impact on TI's business,"" said Logan Purk, analyst at investment firm Edward Jones. Manufacturers of the equipment used to make chips such as KLA Corp (KLAC.O) and Lam Research (LRCX.O) are early winners of the AI boom. Both companies forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street estimates this week, sending their shares higher. ""Advanced AI servers have significantly higher leading-edge logic, memory and storage content versus traditional servers, and every incremental 1% penetration of AI servers and data centres is expected to drive $1 billion to $1.5 billion of additional (chip equipment) investment,"" Lam CEO Tim Archer said on a conference call with analysts. Chipmakers are also increasing production of the high-end chips used to support AI related chips. SK Hynix said demand for AI server memory had more than doubled in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Its DRAM chips, which hold information from applications while the system is in use, sold for a higher price in the second quarter versus the first, on average. The company leads the market in high bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM used in generative AI. It had a 50% market share in HBM as of 2022, followed by Samsung' 40% and Micron's (MU.O) 10%, according to TrendForce.

7,2023-07-27,0.9844,"2023-07-27KLA expects first-quarter revenue above estimates on AI boom|July 27 (Reuters) - Chip-making tools maker KLA Corp (KLAC.O) forecast first-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, boosted by higher investments in artificial intelligence (AI), sending its shares up nearly 3% after the bell. Businesses across sectors have been racing to integrate AI tools after OpenAI's ChatGPT caught the attention of consumers and investors, benefiting companies like KLA that are essential to the chip supply chain. ""KLA is benefiting from demand drivers in markets including silicon wafer and photomask manufacturing, each of which is experiencing general capacity expansion,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders. The company has also benefited from chipmakers looking to diversify their supply chains out of China, as trade tensions with the U.S. intensify. KLA shipped additional manufacturing tools during the fiscal fourth quarter to one of its Chinese memory customers because of a clarification of the export rules, finance chief Bren Higgins said in the conference call with analysts. Companies, including Intel, TSMC, Samsung, Texas Instruments and Micron, are building new plants across the United States, raising the demand for chip tools. KLA makes tools for inspecting the silicon wafer discs, on which semiconductors are built, for defects. The company, forecast first-quarter adjusted profit of $5.35 per share, plus or minus 60 cents. Analysts were expecting $4.75 per share, according to Refinitiv data. In the quarter ended June 30, revenue came in at $2.36 bln while adjusted profit was $5.40 per share. That compared with analysts' estimate for revenue of $2.26 bln and adjusted profit of $4.85. In the June quarter, 30% of KLA's revenue came from China and 21% from Taiwan, while North America contributed to 13% of sales.

8,2023-07-27,0.9922,"2023-07-27Intel turns unexpected profit, higher forecast as PC market slide slows|July 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) on Thursday posted a surprise quarterly profit as a PC market slump started to ease, and forecast third-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up about 6%. The market for personal computers has tumbled over the past year, with inventory piling up because consumers had already bought machines needed during the pandemic. But the glut has started to ease, with PC shipments falling only 11.5% in the June quarter compared to a 30% slump in each of the previous two quarters, Canalys data showed. The PC market improvement prompted Intel to forecast better margins for the third quarter. Its margins in recent quarters were nearly half its historical highs, but Intel said on Thursday it expects profit margins to improve in the second half of the year. ""Intel did outperform almost exclusively on the strength of desktop sales which rebounded from a near-record low last quarter,"" said Edward Snyder, analyst at Charter Equity Research. Intel's stock rally added nearly $9 billion to the company's market value, which in recent years has fallen far below that of rivals including Nvidia (NVDA.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Broadcom (AVGO.O). After over four consecutive quarters of deep declines across its biggest segment that includes personal computers, revenue dropped 12% to $6.8 billion, from $7.7 billion in the year-ago period. Intel's foundry business, which aims to make chips for other companies and is its smallest sales contributor, reported revenue of $232 million, up from $57 million a year ago. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger told Reuters that some of the foundry sales increase came from ""advanced packaging,"" a process in which Intel can combine pieces of chips made by another company to create a more powerful chip. ""There's a lot of interest in the industry for advanced packaging, because it is essential to deliver high-performance computing and AI,"" Gelsinger said. ""So we expect a lot more business coming our way in that area."" On Tuesday, the company said it would work with Swedish telecommunications gear maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) on a chip that Intel will fabricate with its most advanced manufacturing technology it has disclosed. Sales in Intel's data center and artificial intelligence business fell 15% to $4 billion from $4.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Those results beat Wall Street estimates, but reflect that cloud majors Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet expect to ramp up spending on data centers with most of the spending benefiting Nvidia (NVDA.O) that makes chips for AI. The focus on chips that are suited for AI computing in the cloud have hurt the market for server chips for Intel, as has a sluggish recovery in China. ""It is still very clear that Intel is absolutely losing share around server CPUs, and I think it is fair to say that they are fighting for relevance in AI,"" said Jenny Hardy, portfolio manager at GP Bullhound that owns AMD and Nvidia stock. An inventory glut in server central processing units (CPUs), will persist until the second half of the year, Gelsinger said on the conference call, and that data center chip sales will decline modestly in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. Gelsinger said right now Intel has enough customer orders to sell at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips through 2024. Intel forecast adjusted current-quarter earnings per share of 20 cents. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected 16 cents. It forecast adjusted revenue of about $12.9 billion to $13.9 billion, compared to estimates of $13.23 billion. The midpoint of $13.4 billion exceeded estimates but still implies a 12.6% drop over the year in Intel's business. Intel forecast adjusted gross margin of 43% for the third quarter, compared to estimates of 40.6%. Intel shares have risen about 30% so far this year, compared to a 50% rise on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (.SOX) in anticipation of an industry recovery.

Mobileye, which counts BMW (BMWG.DE), Nissan (7201.T) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) among its customers, benefited from strong demand for its technology in North America and Europe, which helped offset weakness in China. Mobileye now expects an annual operating loss in the range of $98 million to $129 million, compared with its previous forecast of a loss of $166 million to $195 million. Still, shares fell nearly 6% in a move several analysts attributed to the lack of an increase in the revenue forecast. ""Mobileye's results were mostly positive, but... I think you have some investors lightening their positions on the good news,"" said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital. The company reiterated its annual revenue forecast range of $2.07 billion to $2.11 billion. In the second quarter, Israel-based Mobileye reported revenue of $454.0 million, compared with analysts' estimates of $450.6 million, according to data from Refinitiv. ""Future business highlights of the quarter included tangible evidence of the depth of our relationship with VW Group and an expansion of meaningful engagements for our advanced portfolio to 9 large OEMs,"" CEO Amnon Shashua said. The company said in May that Porsche (P911_p.DE) and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles would partner with Mobileye to incorporate its automated driving software in future models. Its gross margins widened to 49% for the quarter from 45% in the previous three months, helped by a more than 10% quarter-on-quarter decline in total operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 17 cents per share, beating estimates of 12 cents. Mobileye, in which Intel (INTC.O) retains majority ownership, listed on the Nasdaq last year after raising $861 million in an initial public offering.

While the ECB is also expected to deliver a quarter-point hike to 3.75%, money markets similarly doubt there's another rate rise left in the campaign - wary of a euro zone economy that's slipping in and out of recession this year as disinflation progresses. The euro pushed higher against a softer dollar ahead of the announcement and press conference from ECB chief Christine Lagarde. The yen also firmed as the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its easy policy unchanged on Friday. The rest of the news was dominated by the screed of earnings hitting the headlines. Shares in oil giants Shell (SHEL.L) and TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) fell after they both missed forecasts in reporting big profit drops for the second quarter - the result of the sharp oil price recoil over the last year. Barclays (BARC.L) was again an outlier in banking. Its shares dived 7% despite plans for a hefty buyback after the British lender warned of growing pressure on its UK business and missed forecasts for its investment bank as a global corporate dealmaking slump persists. The euro zone's biggest bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), by contrast, beat Q2 estimates and the stock jumped 4%. In Asia, Hong Kong shares (.HSI) rose in line with world markets, but mainland China indices continue to stumble under a cloud. China's industrial profits extended this year's double-digit pace of declines into a sixth month, falling almost 17% for the year through June.

11,2023-07-27,0.9393,"2023-07-27Morning Bid: Soft landing swings into view|A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Brigid Riley Is the most aggressive U.S. hiking cycle in a generation finished? After Wednesday's 25 basis point hike, markets seem to think so. Traders in Asia cheered a glimpse of the fabled soft landing with Jerome Powell saying the Fed no longer expects a U.S. recession. Stocks rose and the dollar fell across the board. The spotlight now falls on Christine Lagarde and the European Central Bank, which is all but certain to follow with an additional quarter of a percentage point hike later today. The focus will be on President Lagardeâ€™s tone and language for a guide on what's to come - with the outlook likely to move the euro and set the dollar's direction. Markets had expected hawkishness, but were set aflutter last week when council member Klass Knot cast doubt on the need for hikes beyond July. The Bank of Japan is then up on Friday, with perhaps the most unpredictable central bank decision of the week. The yen hit the strong side of 140 to the dollar as nobody wants to be caught short if there's a surprise tweak to yield controls. European futures rose 0.3% and U.S. futures also added 0.3%. On the earnings front, Renault (RENA.PA), TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) and Lâ€™Oreal (OREP.PA) report in France and Intel (INTC.O), Ford (F.N), MasterCard (MA.N), and McDonald's (MCD.N) in the United States. Stimulus hopes drove Chinese stocks higher on Thursday, with the Hang Seng Index (.HSI) up 1.4%, and its tech subindex (.HSTECH) gaining 3% and property stocks (.HSMPI) over 4%.

Restrictions should not be so broad ""that you deny American companies revenue and China can get the product elsewhere, or China can get the product from other countries,"" Raimondo said at a forum. Rules ""will deny some revenue to American companies, but we think it's worth it."" Last week, U.S. chip company executives met with top Biden administration officials, including Raimondo, to discuss China policy, as the most powerful semiconductor lobby group urged a halt to more curbs under consideration. Raimondo said the administration is meeting with companies ""to get to the right place so we don't damage American business but quite frankly protect American national security."" Last year, China accounted for $180 billion in semiconductor purchases, close to a third of the worldwide total of $574.1 billion and the largest single market, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Nvidia (NVDA.O), Qualcomm (INTC.O) and Intel (QCOM.O) have crucial sales riding on China. Qualcomm is the only company with a license from U.S. regulators to sell mobile phone chips to Huawei (HWT.UL). The Biden administration is considering updating a sweeping set of rules imposed in October to hobble China's chip industry and a new executive order restricting some outbound investment. ""This isn't about holding China back or denying them commodity technology,"" Raimondo said. China wants access to the United States most sophisticated technology ""to advance their military and we're not going to allow that,"" she said. The ""timetable is as fast as we can and make sure it is correct,"" she added. Raimondo, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Economic Council director Lael Brainard and National Security Council director Jake Sullivan were among government officials who met with Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia last week, according to a source familiar with the meetings.

The company - which caters to ""fabless"" firms that design chips but outsource manufacturing - is set to be bought by Intel (INTC.O) under a $5.4 billion deal that was announced last year. Demand from the automotive industry has emerged as a bright spot for the chip industry at a time other clients are cutting back on orders, as carmakers had faced a severe semiconductor shortage over the past two years and their supply chains have only started normalizing in 2023. Israel-based Tower provides customers with analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, mainly for the automotive and consumer industries. Its revenue came in at $357 million for the quarter ended June 30, higher than the $354.53 million expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Tower reported net income per share of 46 cents, falling slightly short of analysts' estimates of 49 cents per share. During the quarter, the company repaid $10 million of its debt, as compared with $27 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.4019"

Intel has lost its lead in manufacturing the smallest and most power-efficient semiconductors to rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW). A key piece of Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's plan announced in 2021 to regain that lead and turn the company around has been to pack five generations of chip manufacturing advances into four years. Intel said that the new Ericsson chip will use Intel's ""18A"" manufacturing technology and is among the first chips from outside customers that Intel has will use the technology. Intel and Ericsson did not provide details on when the chip will hit the market, but Intel has previously said that its 18A manufacturing technology will be ready by 2025.

15,2023-07-25,0.891,"2023-07-25Germany earmarks 20 billion euros in subsidies for chip industry|BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, July 25 (Reuters) - Germany plans to invest around 20 billion euros ($22.15 billion) in the semiconductor industry in the coming years, the economy ministry said on Tuesday, as it seeks to attract global chipmakers to set up factories in the country. European governments want to lower dependency on Asian countries for semiconductors and build capacity in the region by offering subsidies through the EU Chips Act that aims to double the bloc's share of global chip output to 20% by 2030. Intel (INTC.O) last month laid out plans to spend more than 30 billion euros to develop two chip-making plants in Magdeburg, Germany's biggest ever foreign investment. The ministry said Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer TSMC (2330.TW) has also expressed interest in investing in a semiconductor production facility in Germany and that the ministry was in close contact with the company over an investment decision. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has been in talks with the German state of Saxony since 2021 about building a fabrication plant, or ""fab"", in Dresden. Of the total package, Intel will get subsidies worth nearly 10 billion euros. The rest would go to other chipmakers including Infineon (IFXGn.DE), GlobalFoundries (GFS.O) and TSMC. Analysts expect TSMC to get billions in subsidies, but that might lead to other chipmakers asking for more. The government has not disclosed the subsidy TSMC might get. ""The issue we have is that while GlobalFoundries has been directed to millions in funding, TSMC, the dominant player, is getting billions of euros,"" GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield told Reuters. ""This is why we think there will be market distortions,"" he said. GlobalFoundries, which has been in Germany for decades, has been expanding its capacity in Dresden. Chipmaker Infineon is also building its 5-billion-euro semiconductor plant in Dresden, due to start production in 2026. The German subsidies will be drawn from the Climate and Transformation Fund from 2024 onwards, the ministry said, adding that it could only give funding for individual projects after European Commission approval. The amount is subject to approval from the European Commission. ($1 = 0.9029 euro) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

16,2023-07-25,0.9493,"2023-07-25U.S. will be short 67,000 chip workers by 2030, industry group says|July 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. semiconductor industry faces a shortfall of roughly 67,000 workers by 2030, according to an industry association study published on Tuesday. The chip industry's workforce is projected to grow to 460,000 by the end of the decade, up from roughly 345,000 this year. But at the current rate that people are graduating from schools, the U.S. will not produce enough qualified workers to fill the increase, according to the study prepared by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Oxford Economics. The study comes as the U.S. works to strengthen its domestic chip sector. The CHIPS Act, which sets aside money for new manufacturing sites, and research and development, was signed into law on Aug. 9. The Commerce Department is overseeing the $39 billion in manufacturing subsidies stipulated under the act, and companies such as Intel Corp (INTC.O), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) have said they will apply for them. The law also created a 25% investment tax credit for building new chip factories, or fabs, that is worth $24 billion. Those factories will create jobs, the SIA said. The projected shortage includes computer scientists, engineers and technicians. Roughly half of the future chip industry jobs will be engineers. ""This has been a problem that we've been facing for a long time,"" SIA President John Neuffer said. ""But with the CHIPS Act in particular, and the kind of the bending the arc of history towards more manufacture here on U.S. shores, it really kind of threw this acute problem into bold relief."" The shortage of skilled chip workers is part of a larger shortfall of science, technology, engineering and math graduates in the U.S., according to the report. By the end of 2023, 1.4 million positions may go unfulfilled. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9493"
17,2023-07-24,0.9907,"2023-07-24Global shares, U.S. yields rise as investors eye rates, earnings|NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Global equity markets and Treasury yields rose on Monday as investors braced for interest rate decisions from key central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, as well as corporate earnings that may shed light on the state of the economy. An overwhelming majority of traders expect the Fed to raise rates by 25 basis points at its policy meeting this week, according to CME Group data, helping to revive concerns of a looming recession following resilient U.S. economic growth. The European Central Bank is also expected to maintain a hawkish stance when it meets this week, while the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its super-loose monetary policy intact after its meeting. The yields on 10-year notes were at 3.874%, rebounding from an early session decline, while the rate-sensitive two-year yields were up at 4.8917%. Yet, markets are also anticipating buoyant results from major U.S. companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), whose performance has mostly underpinned the nearly 19% year-to-date gain in the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX). ""The most over-used phrase in this industry is 'cautiously optimistic' but that is where we are,"" said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund. ""We still think that in general the economy is going to be growing but there will be continued rolling recessions of segments of the economy, which is really healthy because it tends to lead to significant long-term bull markets,"" Plumb said. The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up 0.21%, while European stocks (.STOXX) added just 0.06%. On Wall Street, the three main indexes closed higher, led by gains in financial, consumer discretionary, technology and energy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.52% to 35,411.24, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.40% to 4,554.64 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 0.19% to 14,058.87. ""The consensus is for the Fed to raise by 25 basis points and then some more indication that they could be at the end. We don't have much insight that it would be different but if it is, then it would dramatically increase the volatility of markets,"" Plumb added. The U.S. dollar edged up against major currencies after economic data continued to show the resilience of the American economy compared to its peers. The purchasing managers' survey showed on Monday that U.S. business activity slowed to a five-month low in July, dragged down by decelerating service sector growth, but the data was better than similar surveys out of Europe. The dollar index rose 0.297%, with the euro down 0.56% to $1.1061. Oil prices rose by more than 2% to a near three-month high buoyed by tightening supply, rising U.S. gasoline demand, hopes for Chinese stimulus measures and technical buying. Brent futures rose 2.1% to settle at $82.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 2.1%, to settle at $78.74. Prices of safe-haven gold were choppy as the dollar advanced. Spot gold dropped 0.3% to $1,954.50 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures gained 0.06% to $1,960.30 an ounce. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
