The government's application for an injunction came after ""Glory to Hong Kong"" was played mistakenly at several international sporting events, instead of China's national anthem ""March of the Volunteers"". China-ruled Hong Kong does not have its own anthem but as a Chinese territory since its return from British rule in 1997, it uses China's anthem. The protest song was widely sung and played during the city's months-long pro-democracy and anti-China protests in 2019. It was later deemed unlawful after China imposed a national security law on the financial hub as part of a crackdown on dissent. In a written judgement rejecting the injunction, High Court Judge Anthony Chan wrote: ""The court recognised the engagement of the right to freedom of expression in the consideration of this application"", while noting ""chilling effects"" that might be generated if the injunction was granted. ""It is by no means over-stretched to envisage that perfectly innocent people would distance themselves from what may be lawful acts involving the song for fear of trespassing the injunction which has severe consequences,"" Chan added. ""I cannot be satisfied that it is just and convenient to grant the injunction. This application is accordingly dismissed."" When the government first applied to the court for a total ban of the song in June, including publishing or disseminating the tune, it was temporarily taken down by several distributors from several online music streaming platforms including iTunes (AAPL.O) and Spotify (SPOT.N). DGX Music, the music group behind the song, later uploaded a new version of the album on the music steaming platforms. Jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and barrister Chow Hang-tung, whom the court did not allow to appear in the case, wrote in a Facebook post on July 22: ""I will continue to say what I have to say, sing what I want to sing. Glory to Hong Kong."". Hong Kong officials had also pressured Google (GOOGL.O) to change its search results to display China's anthem instead of ""Glory to Hong Kong"" when users searched for Hong Kong's national anthem, but the technology giant refused. A senior Hong Kong official, Sun Dong, said Google had told the government to first prove that the song violated local laws - thus prompting the legal move. Google parent Alphabet declined to comment. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee told reporters the government would closely examine the judgement before deciding whether to appeal. He said the government would not shirk from any measures to safeguard national security. Rights groups and journalists association welcomed the move. ""Today the Hong Kong High Court took a welcome stand and defended free speech. The Hong Kong government should respect the decision and refrain from making further attempts to censor the protest song,"" Human Rights Watch's China director Sophie Richardson, said in a statement. The head of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Ronson Chan, said outside the court that the judgement was very reasonable. ""Exercising public power would create a chilling effect, threatening innocent people,"" Chan said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

1,2023-07-27,0.9922,"2023-07-27Intel turns unexpected profit, higher forecast as PC market slide slows|July 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) on Thursday posted a surprise quarterly profit as a PC market slump started to ease, and forecast third-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up about 6%. The market for personal computers has tumbled over the past year, with inventory piling up because consumers had already bought machines needed during the pandemic. But the glut has started to ease, with PC shipments falling only 11.5% in the June quarter compared to a 30% slump in each of the previous two quarters, Canalys data showed. The PC market improvement prompted Intel to forecast better margins for the third quarter. Its margins in recent quarters were nearly half its historical highs, but Intel said on Thursday it expects profit margins to improve in the second half of the year. ""Intel did outperform almost exclusively on the strength of desktop sales which rebounded from a near-record low last quarter,"" said Edward Snyder, analyst at Charter Equity Research. Intel's stock rally added nearly $9 billion to the company's market value, which in recent years has fallen far below that of rivals including Nvidia (NVDA.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Broadcom (AVGO.O). After over four consecutive quarters of deep declines across its biggest segment that includes personal computers, revenue dropped 12% to $6.8 billion, from $7.7 billion in the year-ago period. Intel's foundry business, which aims to make chips for other companies and is its smallest sales contributor, reported revenue of $232 million, up from $57 million a year ago. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger told Reuters that some of the foundry sales increase came from ""advanced packaging,"" a process in which Intel can combine pieces of chips made by another company to create a more powerful chip. ""There's a lot of interest in the industry for advanced packaging, because it is essential to deliver high-performance computing and AI,"" Gelsinger said. ""So we expect a lot more business coming our way in that area."" On Tuesday, the company said it would work with Swedish telecommunications gear maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) on a chip that Intel will fabricate with its most advanced manufacturing technology it has disclosed. Sales in Intel's data center and artificial intelligence business fell 15% to $4 billion from $4.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Those results beat Wall Street estimates, but reflect that cloud majors Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet expect to ramp up spending on data centers with most of the spending benefiting Nvidia (NVDA.O) that makes chips for AI. The focus on chips that are suited for AI computing in the cloud have hurt the market for server chips for Intel, as has a sluggish recovery in China. ""It is still very clear that Intel is absolutely losing share around server CPUs, and I think it is fair to say that they are fighting for relevance in AI,"" said Jenny Hardy, portfolio manager at GP Bullhound that owns AMD and Nvidia stock. An inventory glut in server central processing units (CPUs), will persist until the second half of the year, Gelsinger said on the conference call, and that data center chip sales will decline modestly in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. Gelsinger said right now Intel has enough customer orders to sell at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips through 2024. Intel forecast adjusted current-quarter earnings per share of 20 cents. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected 16 cents. It forecast adjusted revenue of about $12.9 billion to $13.9 billion, compared to estimates of $13.23 billion. The midpoint of $13.4 billion exceeded estimates but still implies a 12.6% drop over the year in Intel's business. Intel forecast adjusted gross margin of 43% for the third quarter, compared to estimates of 40.6%. Intel shares have risen about 30% so far this year, compared to a 50% rise on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (.SOX) in anticipation of an industry recovery.

After several months of muted spending, companies are raising their expenditure on ads on signs of cooling inflation and improving consumer sentiment. ""We have begun to see some ad verticals improve, which resulted in modest YoY platform revenue growth in Q2, and we are well positioned to re-accelerate growth as the ad market recovers,"" company executives said in a letter to shareholders. Roku expects $815 million in net revenue in the July-September period, higher than analysts' projection of $809.6 million, according to Refinitiv data. Chief Financial Officer Dan Jedda said the pickup in ad spending is coming from the consumer products, and health and wellness industries, while tech, media and entertainment remains challenged. Roku's strong guidance comes after large digital platforms Meta Platforms (META.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) delivered upbeat results on higher digital ad sales. ""In addition to capturing advertising dollars shifting from traditional linear distribution to over-the-top, Roku has made progress in clawing away spend from other digital channels,"" said Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley. Roku, which offers streaming devices and also has its own ad-supported channel, posted better-than-expected results for the quarter ended June. Net revenue grew 11% to $847.2 million, above estimates of $774.5 million, while adjusted loss came in at 76 cents per share, lower than the estimate of $1.26. The company said it added 1.9 million ""active accounts"" from the previous quarter to 73.5 million. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9877"
3,2023-07-27,0.9956,"2023-07-27Facebook parent Meta sees advertising jump, tops Wall Street targets|July 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) on Wednesday reported a strong rise in advertising revenue, topping Wall Street financial targets for the second quarter and forecasting third-quarter revenue above market expectations. The results from Meta, Facebook's parent company, come a day after a strong performance from Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and make the case that consumers, and the advertisers eager to reach them, are spending despite broad economic concerns. Still, the company also forecast that expenses would rise in both 2023 and 2024, citing costs including legal fees and increased spending on infrastructure considered key to the tech sector's feverish AI race. That spending comes after aggressive cost-cutting in other parts of the company, including safety teams and basic business functions. Meta shares were up 7.5% in after-hours trade. ""We continue to see strong engagement across our apps and we have the most exciting roadmap I've seen in a while with Llama 2, Threads, Reels, new AI products in the pipeline, and the launch of Quest 3 this fall,"" Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said. Meta's second-quarter revenue grew 11% to $32 billion in the quarter ended June 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of $31.12 billion. Ad revenue rose 12% in the quarter, faster than growth at Google, where ad revenue rose 3%. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.98 topped Wall Street targets of $2.91, according to data from Refinitiv. The social media giant has been climbing back from a bruising 2022, buoyed by hype around emerging AI technology and an austerity drive in which it has shed around 21,000 employees since last fall. The company's shares have more than doubled in value this year as a result. Advertisers are reinforcing those gains by pumping money into digital ads again after months of muted spending, heartened by signs that the economy may overcome a bout of high inflation without suffering a major meltdown. Brands are hedging their bets, however, and sticking with tried and true platforms. That helps Meta and Alphabet while punishing smaller players like Snap (SNAP.N), which reported disappointing sales on Tuesday. Meta's revenue forecast did not specify whether the figure includes any sales that might come from the recently launched Threads app, which does not yet have ads. The revenue gains provide relief as Meta makes massive investments to upgrade its data centers and stay competitive in an emerging arms race around AI technology, while continuing to invest more than $10 billion a year in a longer-term bet on ""metaverse"" hardware and software. Meta cut its capital expenditure forecast for 2023, driven in part by pushing some costs related to artificial intelligence into 2024, when capex is expected to grow. Zuckerberg told investors that executives were ""debating heavily"" how much AI capacity to bring online to prepare for a potential explosion in need. He saw three product categories for AI: features for advertisers, AI agents on chat and internal company productivity tools. He said he envisioned some revenue coming from Meta's recently released Llama 2 model, which is largely open source but requires a license for use by companies with more than 700 million users. ""We want this to be open. But if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to basically be reselling these services, that's something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for,"" Zuckerberg said. Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is responsible for developing metaverse-oriented technology like augmented reality glasses, reported sales of $276 million, down from $452 million in the same quarter last year. The unit lost $3.7 billion in the second quarter, putting it on track to have far higher costs than the $5 billion annual target set out in a widely circulated investor note in the fall. The unit has lost more than $40 billion since 2021, including $13.7 billion last year. Meta said it expected Reality Labs operating losses to ""increase meaningfully"" in 2024 as the company continued to invest in augmented and virtual reality and ""scale our ecosystem."" Zuckerberg had previously said Meta would ""pace"" investments in the division after 2023. He told investors he understood why many of them would feel discomfort over such a long-term bet. The company expects 2023 total expenses in the range of $88 billion to $91 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $86 billion to $90 billion, citing ""legal-related expenses."" Meta said second-quarter expenses included legal costs of $1.87 billion, mostly related to a fine by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner in May for transferring user information to the United States. The fine itself was 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion). It said it expected ""higher infrastructure-related costs"" in 2024, as well as growth in payroll expenses ""as we evolve our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.""

The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by a widely expected 25 basis points, marking the 11th hike in the U.S. central bank's past 12 policy meetings. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference the central bank will make decisions meeting by meeting, closely watching economic data, but noted that a rate cut is very unlikely this year. Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients that the Fed's statement did not signal a slower pace of hikes in the future, but that the bank was expecting a hold in September. ""The message for the market was that it didn't move the needle. There's always a fear of a big surprise,"" said Angelo Kourfafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones. Powell's message was clearly that the Fed will wait and see economic data to make new decisions, said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. ""I think the Fed won't stop until they see wage inflation down."" Following long-awaited earnings on Tuesday, big tech companies' shares had mixed reactions. Microsoft (MSFT.O) eased 3.72% after laying out an aggressive spending plan to meet demand for its new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered services. The Windows maker still surpassed estimates for quarterly revenue and profit. Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.78% after the Google parent's second-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street expectations on steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising. The NYSE FANG+ index (.NYFANG), which houses many megacap growth names, dropped 0.72%. The index has rallied roughly 75% so far this year on optimism over AI and hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle. ""After extreme gains so far this year in big tech stocks, we have now moved to a phase where each company's stock price is very non-correlated to one another,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group.

5,2023-07-26,0.9795,"2023-07-26Morning Bid: China realism returns, Powell has spoken|July 27 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. A sense of cautious optimism could be the tone across Asia early on Thursday as China's markets cool down, investors welcome fairly balanced comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and await the European Central Bank's rate decision. After a volatile start to markets this week, the concentration of major 'event risk' - the Fed and ECB meetings, the Bank of Japan's policy decision on Friday and potential details on China's stimulus measures - may be keeping investors from taking big bets. That said, some big earnings reports from some of the biggest U.S. tech firms continue to roll in, meaning there could be big price swings in individual stocks and sectors under the hood of the broader indices. This was in evidence on Wednesday on Wall Street. The Nasdaq fell only 0.1% and 'big tech' fell less than 1% but that masked huge moves in some shares which added or wiped out tens of billions of dollars of market cap. Microsoft fell 4%, Snap plunged 15%, while Alphabet surged 5.5%. Shares in Meta jumped 7% in after hours trade after the Facebook owner reported stronger-than-expected Q2 revenues and forecast strong Q3 revenues. Investors in Asia will also wake up to the 11th U.S. interest rate hike since the Fed began hiking rates last year - and the highest rates in 22 years - and a fairly balanced policy outlook for the coming months from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He left the door open to further tightening but also said the Fed could stay on hold if the data warranted and stressed that decisions will be made on a meeting by meeting basis. His measured remarks helped ensure a fairly subdued day on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrials rose 0.24%, insignificant in itself but at the same time historic - it was the 13th consecutive daily rise, the index's longest winning streak since January 1987. Few would have imagined then that the market's biggest ever fall - the 22% crash on Black Monday - was only nine months away. Back in Asia, a sense of realism returned over the expected measures from Beijing to revitalize the economy. After outsized gains on Tuesday - a 14% surge in property stocks - major indices in China and Hong Kong closed in the red. The main event on Thursday's economic calendar is Chinese industrial profits for June, which could underline how weak the economy has been since Covid restrictions were lifted. Profits have been falling every month for a year, registering double-digit declines every month so far this year. They slumped 18.8% in May. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday: - China industrial profits (June) - Australia import and export prices (Q2) - European Central Bank policy decision Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Microsoft's (MSFT.O) shares fell 3.6% in early trading as the company laid out an aggressive AI-related spending plan, saying deeper investments in AI are required before gains trickle to the bottom line. Microsoft is set to shed about $100 billion from its market capitalization if the loses hold until close of trading. Its shares had gained 46.4% up to yesterday's close. ""AI will generate a lot of revenue and earnings for such firms, but a lot of investors have been buying the rumor and now that we have earnings, they are taking profits,"" Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist for Murphy & Sylvest said. ""There's still a lot of excitement around AI, but nobody quite understands what that means for the bottom line of many of these companies."" The NYSE FANG+ index (.NYFANG), which houses many megacap growth names, was down 0.2%. The index has risen about 76% so far this year, driven by the frenzy around AI. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) was an outlier. Its shares rose 5.6% after the company beat expectations for second-quarter results. Alphabet looks set to add about $100 billion to its market capitalization. The recent rally has driven up Microsoft's valuation. The stock is trading at 31 times 12-month forward earnings, compared to a PE multiple of 20 for Alphabet. ""The tech earnings season has started on a mixed note,"" said Mark Haefele, global wealth management chief investment officer at UBS in a client note. ""The tone set by quarterly results over the next week will be crucial to the performance of tech stocks through the rest of the third quarter."" Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the world's most valuable publicly listed company, and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are set to report quarterly earnings next week. FED FEARS vs. AI BOOST Investors also remained cautious on Wednesday, with Wall Street's main indexes muted ahead of a likely Federal Reserve interest rate hike later in the day that could push borrowing costs to their highest since the global financial crisis. Large tech companies, which rely heavily on borrowed money, have been pressured since the Fed started its tightening cycle to tame inflation. However, optimism over AI and hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle have supported tech stocks in recent months. Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital, said tech stocks tend to be fairly exposed to such sentiment around central bank policy as many of them are reliant on robust economic growth to deliver the returns they promise. ""There are valid concerns that the U.S. economy is weakening, but until the Fed sees sustained evidence of softening inflationary pressures, the hawkish stance will be maintained, even at the risk of tipping the economy into negative growth."" Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) shares rose 1.0% after Alibaba's (9988.HK) cloud computing division said it has become the first Chinese enterprise to support the company's open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model Llama. Amazon shares dropped 1.3% after a media report said the Federal Trade Commission is finalizing an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shares tumbled 18.3% after the photo messaging app-owner reported a weaker third-quarter forecast than analysts had expected on Tuesday. ""Band-Aids not fixing bullet holes yet,"" wrote Bernstein stock analyst, Mark Shmulik. The company's Snapchat app has added a new AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions to attract more users, but Shmulik notes the company has struggled to consistently grow revenue and catch up to rivals like Facebook-owner Meta. ""Snapchat is running to stay in the same place while peers enviously get back on the ad growth track,"" Shmulik said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

8,2023-07-26,0.9836,"2023-07-26AI lesson for Microsoft and Google: Spend money to make money|July 25 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence is expected to pay off big for tech giants including Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) someday. But expect deeper investments before gains trickle to the bottom line, the companies said on Tuesday. Microsoft said costs rose sharply as it built new data centers to support AI and that capital expenditures will continue to rise as it buys chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to power those data centers. The Windows maker's shares were down more than 3% on Wednesday, while Alphabet gained nearly 7%. Microsoft is bearing AI costs in two ways, analysts said: to power its own products such as its forthcoming $30-a-month Copilot AI assistant, and to serve companies wanting to use its Azure cloud computing services to create AI products. Microsoft executives said the service will start generating the bulk of its revenue in the second half of its fiscal 2024 ending June 30. ""They're buying a bunch of H100s,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst of Creative Strategies, referring to Nvidia's flagship chips for AI. ""You're probably going to see a similar thing with Amazon (AMZN.O), if not this quarter then the next quarter, because both of them are the clouds that the vast majority of the market is using for training (AI systems) right now."" Alphabet, however, kept down costs, though not for long. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who will become president and chief investment officer, said delays in data center construction are why second-quarter capex was lower than expected. ""As far as AI is concerned, while Google may have spent upwards of $200 billion on AI investments over the past decade, much of that isn't necessarily appreciated by users and investors,"" said Scott Kessler, global sector lead for technology media and telecommunications at Third Bridge. One advantage Google has, analysts said, is that it has its own custom chip for handling AI work called the Tensor Processor Unit (TPU), which helps lower costs. Microsoft may be ""aggressively buying Nvidia chips, given Microsoft does not have its own silicon as an alternative,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. But Google conceded that it will buy chips from other companies as well as using its own, and Porat said that spending could put a drag on profit and growth.

The world's fourth most valuable firm was on track to add more than $80 billion to its market capitalization. Its shares have rallied 39% this year on the hype around artificial intelligence. Wall Street analysts said the company's better-than-expected quarterly earnings showed the strong position of Google Search, steady growth in the cloud business and that Alphabet was well placed to compete with Microsoft in AI. ""Don't call it an AI comeback,"" said analysts at Jefferies, adding that Google has been an AI-first company for seven years. Jefferies was among the 27 brokerages that raised their price targets, with several of them saying AI had started to contribute to Google's cloud revenue and helped drive a 28% growth in the quarter that widely surpassed expectations. Alphabet has rolled out a series of AI products this year and revamped its search engine with the technology as it competes with Microsoft in a race to dominate the nascent field. ""Contrary to fears, AI everywhere is not, at least now, causing margin indigestion, or disrupting search. On the contrary, it appears to have potential to make Google a share-gainer in cloud services,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a note to clients. Microsoft also topped expectations on Tuesday, powered by growth in its Azure cloud unit - the part of its business best situated to capitalize on the booming interest in AI. But its shares were down 3.3% on worries that investments in the technology behind ChatGPT were driving up costs. The median price target on Alphabet now stands at $145, which is nearly 19% higher than the stock's last close.

The Fed's communication could set the tone for markets ahead of policy decisions from the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Friday. The ECB appears poised to make another small hike while the BOJ is widely expected to leave its ultra-easy policy settings on hold. Euro zone June M3 annual growth and lending data on Wednesday are unlikely to affect markets ahead of the ECB's decision. Meta Platforms (META.O) stands out among company earnings reports due on Wednesday in the United States, which also include AT&T (T.N), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO.N), U.S. railroad operator Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), eBay (EBAY.O), Boeing (BA.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N). Both Microsoft and Alphabet announced strong earnings results after the U.S. close on Tuesday. In Europe, France-based retail distributor Carrefour and global foods and beverage company Danone (DANO.PA) report, as do GSK (GSK.L) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI). In Asia, markets are awaiting details on fresh economic stimulus measures from China following the Politburo's pledge on Monday to step up policy support for the faltering economy. Chinese stock markets were mostly lower on Wednesday following a steep rally the day before. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (.HSI) fell 0.8%, trailed by its property and tech subindexes. China's blue-chip CSI300 (.CSI300) index was down 0.3% while the CSI 300 Real Estate index gained 0.2%. Australian CPI data released on Wednesday showed inflation slowed more than expected in the June quarter, giving the Aussie a knock but allowing the Reserve Bank of Australia some breathing room before its next policy meeting on Aug. 1.

11,2023-07-26,0.9879,"2023-07-26Morning Bid: Tech splits, banks merge and Fed decides|A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Alphabet outshone Microsoft as the latest two of the tech giants reported earnings overnight, with another regional bank merger exciting financial stocks as the Fed decides on interest rates. The blizzard of market-moving news has done little to rein in the relentless climb of Wall St stocks so far this week, with the S&P500 (.SPX) hitting new highs for the year and the Dow Jones bluechips index (.DJI) clocking a 12th straight daily gain on Tuesday for the first time in six years. Unlucky for some perhaps, but a 13th today would make it the longest winning streak for the Dow since 1987. But this year's supercharged tech sector (.NDX), (.NYFANG) has been more hesitant in returning to the year's highs as its leading lights dish out earnings updates, with a high bar to impress given the scale of AI-infused share price already in 2023. Tesla and Netflix stumbled last week despite headline profit beats and Microsoft's (MSFT.O) ostensible forecast-beating earnings were the latest to underwhelm overnight, as disappointing projections for its cloud business sent its stock down 4% out of hours. Snap plunged 20% before the bell as its guidance fell short too. It not impossible to wow the gallery though. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) climbed 7% after hours as its results beat was accompanied by a surprising rebound in advertising and warmer words on its cloud operations. Meta Platforms (META.O) is up next after Wednesday's closing bell and its share rose 2%. Amazon (AMZN.O) lost 2% on reports the Federal Trade Commission is finalizing an antitrust lawsuit against the firm. The net impact on overall index futures has been marginal so far on Wednesday - a tick down in Nasdaq and Dow futures and a modest nudge up in S&P500. The wider market is held in check awaiting the Federal Reserve's latest quarter-point interest rate rise to 22-year highs of 5.25-5.50%, possibly its last in the cycle if futures are correct. U.S. two-year Treasury yields retreated into the decision and the dollar (.DXY) dialed back too. In the background, the regional bank sector was enlivened by more merger activity. Shares in PacWest (PACW.O) rose nearly 38% in premarket trading after news that smaller rival Banc of California (BANC.N), which rose 14%, had agreed to buy the lender for $1.1 billion. Wells Fargo (WFC.N), meantime, climbed 2.8% after the bank's board authorized a new $30 billion share buyback program. The Fed decision comes in the wake of another set of forecast-beating U.S. consumer confidence readings for July. Economists assume the central bank will retain a hawkish tone but keep its options on another hike open as it will have almost two months of data to assess before meeting again on September 20. Elsewhere, the European earnings season was in full swing too, with banks dominating the diary and the European Central Bank meeting tomorrow. Deutsche Bank < DBKGn.DE> stock fell 1% after the lender reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit as an investment banking slump offset higher interest income. With the Bank of Japan also meeting this week, the yen fell back after a top government official quoted BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda as saying he will maintain accommodative monetary conditions. This week's China's stock rebound (.CSI300) also cooled amid a lack of detail around the Politburo's economic stimulus plans and as property worries continued to rankle. Trading of Chinese property developer Country Garden's (2007.HK) bonds was halted after a more than 20% drop in price on Wednesday. Events to watch for on Wednesday: * U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision, followed by press conference from Chair Jerome Powell * U.S. corporate earnings: Meta Platforms, eBay, Boeing, General Dynamics, AT&T, Seagate, Union Pacific, CME, Hilton Worldwide, Coca-Cola, Molina, Ameriprise, Lam Research, ADP, Allegion, Fiserv, American Water Works, United Rentals, Otis, Everest, Align, Globe Life, Rollins, Edwards Lifesciences etc * U.S. June new home sales * U.S. Treasury auctions 2-year floating rate notes Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9879"

In a hearing before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dario Amodei, chief executive of the AI company Anthropic, said that AI could help otherwise unskilled malevolent actors develop biological weapons. ""Certain steps in bioweapons production involve knowledge that can't be found on Google or in textbooks and requires a high level of expertise,"" said Amodei, whose company worked with biosecurity experts on a study of biological risks arising from AI. ""We found that today's AI tools can fill in some of these steps."" Amodei said that AI was not yet capable of helping to build a biological weapon, calling it a ""medium-term"" risk. ""By enabling many more actors to carry out large-scale biological attacks, we believe this represents a grave threat to U.S. national security,"" he said. [1/2]ChatGPT logo and AI Artificial Intelligence words are seen in this illustration taken, May 4, 2023.

Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican, called for safeguards ""that will ensure this new technology is actually good for the American people."" The hearing takes place days after AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) made voluntary commitments to the White House last week to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to help make the technology safer.

13,2023-07-26,0.9979,"2023-07-26AI mania drives Wall Street to higher close ahead of earnings|July 25 (Reuters) - The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed higher on Tuesday, leading gains on Wall Street amid investor excitement about artificial intelligence before earnings reports from megacap technology companies Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) after the bell. Both Microsoft and Alphabet have launched an array of AI products since OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released ChatGPT in late 2022. Investors expect the new products will help tech giants offset a slowdown in their cloud businesses. Shares in the owner of Google and the maker of Windows climbed 0.6% and 1.7%, respectively. ""When you have this much enthusiasm for a specific investing theme, you don't need much of a reason for markets to move. It's inertia,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. With the U.S. central bank on track for another 25-basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday, policymakers face a choice over how much weight to put on recent economic data. ""The Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow is reminding the market that it will be the second to last, if not the last, interest rate increase, and that has been a major concern for markets, particularly for tech stocks,"" said Rishi Sadarangani, chief investment officer at hedge fund R/Evolution Gate. A survey showed consumer confidence increased to a two-year high in July, amid continued optimism about the labor market despite worries about a recession. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index (.IXIC) has rallied this year, helped by outsized gains in rate-sensitive megacap growth companies and hopes for an end to the U.S. Federal Reserve's tightening cycle. Companies outside tech are also performing well as lower valuations attract investors. The blue-chip Dow (.DJI) inched up for 13th day in a row, even as a 0.87% slide in Boeing (BA.N) capped gains. RTX (RTX.N) tumbled 10.2% after saying many of its Pratt & Whitney GTF engines that power Airbus A320neo jets will need ""accelerated removals and inspections"". The S&P composite 1500 passenger airlines sub index (.SPCOMAIR) dropped 3.45%, bogged down by a 9.7% fall in Alaska Air (ALK.N) after the airline's annual revenue growth outlook missed expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 26.83 points, or 0.08%, to 35,438.07, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 12.82 points, or 0.28%, to 4,567.46 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 85.69 points, or 0.61%, to 14,144.56. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.75 billion shares, compared with the 10.32 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Most of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were subdued. But materials stocks gained 1.76%, tracking rising metal prices as investors cheered pledges of support from a politburo meeting in China. General Electric (GE.N) jumped 6.27% after raising its annual adjusted profit forecast, while General Motors (GM.N) slumped 3.51% after it posted a decline in adjusted pre-tax profit and margins in its key North American market from the previous quarter. 3M Co (MMM.N) rose 5.33% as the industrial conglomerate raised its annual adjusted profit forecast. The S&P 500 earnings are now expected to decline 7.7% for the second quarter, as per Refinitiv data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

14,2023-07-25,0.9967,"2023-07-25Alphabet profit beats expectations, CFO Porat to assume new role|SAN FRANCISCO, July 25 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) second-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street expectations on Tuesday and the Google parent announced that its long-time CFO, Ruth Porat, would assume a new role while the company sought a new finance chief. Alphabet's results were helped by steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising. The shares jumped 8% in after-hours trading. Shares of rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) were down slightly after it also reported results on Tuesday, while shares of Meta Platforms (META.O), a company also highly dependent on ad sales, rose as much as 2%. ""Not only did Google deliver fantastic earnings per share, exceeding expectations at a time when investors were questioning its ability to keep up with other tech giants amid the AI frenzy, it also did so by a considerable margin,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""This strongly indicates that a new growth phase for the giant is likely under way."" He added, ""Google has finally consolidated itself as a leading force in the highly-disputed cloud sector and now has room to focus its expansion in the AI field."" Porat, hired in 2015, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent female executives and oversaw tremendous growth at Alphabet. She will become chief investment officer and president starting Sept. 1 and lead 2024 planning while her successor is sought. Porat was hired from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), where she was finance chief. In her new role, she will oversee the company’s so-called Other Bets portfolio, the unit for more risky hardware and services ventures, as well as help manage the company’s global investments. Advertisers, who make up a big share of Alphabet's revenue, have pulled back on spending precious dollars on untested platforms, helping the Google parent as well as Facebook owner Meta Platforms. But Alphabet's second-quarter results are sure to please investors concerned over a broader advertiser pullback following the meteoric growth of Web services during the pandemic, as consumers returned to physical retail. Silicon Valley has been buzzing over generative artificial intelligence software that can give long-winded responses to user queries and is predicted to be the next leap forward for Big Tech. Alphabet rolled out AI products at its annual I/O developer conference in May and it revamped its search engine to include generative AI. The new AI technology comes at a cost: the largest component of Alphabet's second-quarter capital spending was for servers and a ""meaningful investment"" in AI computing, Porat said in a conference call. Advertising is coming to the company's revamped search, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on the call. Alphabet is testing what formats are effective and where to place ads inside of its AI-powered search. Presently, 80% of advertisers use at least one AI-driven search product, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said on the call. The company plans to integrate generative AI into other products such as Gmail, Google Photos and its Android mobile operating system. Generative AI tech can create text, images and video that resemble what people produce. Still, the results released on Tuesday show that ad sales are still king. Investors punished social media company Snap (SNAP.N) on Tuesday for its disappointing ad sales in the quarter. Revenue at Google Cloud, which is among the biggest cloud service providers, rose 28% to $8.1 billion, besting expectations of $7.75 billion, and maintaining roughly the same rate of growth as the first quarter. Microsoft's Azure revenue rose 26%, ahead of the growth estimate from Visible Alpha. Analysts and industry experts have said they expect cloud business growth to pick up toward the end of the year, with quarter-ended June being the trough as macro uncertainty begins to clear. Investors expect AI to become a major growth driver for cloud businesses within a year, with Microsoft's Azure leading the pack followed by Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) AWS and Google Cloud. Ad sales for Google's YouTube video service unit rose 4.4% to $7.67 billion. Alphabet reported net profit of $1.44 per share for the April-June period, compared with estimates of $1.34 per share. Revenue for the quarter stood at $74.6 billion, compared with estimates of $72.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

15,2023-07-25,0.9933,"2023-07-25Morning Bid: China hopes, U.S. big tech fire up markets|July 26 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. Asian stock markets will open strongly on Wednesday if the previous day's China- and U.S.-fueled momentum doesn't wilt, as investors brace for a triple whammy of major central bank policy decisions over the coming 72 hours. On the regional data front, Australian consumer inflation grabs the spotlight. Economists expect inflation to have slowed in June and over the second quarter, which could lean investors toward thinking interest rates have peaked at 4.10%. It's not often China is the source of much optimism for investors these days, but that it exactly where markets find themselves after the country's top leaders on Monday pledged to ramp up support for the struggling economy. China's blue chip equity index rose nearly 3% for its best day this year, and Chinese property stocks surged 8% for their biggest rise this year too. Hong Kong's main property stocks index jumped 14%, the biggest rise since March last year. Beijing's top policy-making Politburo said it will implement macro adjustments ""in a precise and forceful manner"" to support an economy undergoing a ""tortuous"" post-COVID recovery. Fine words and sentiment, but as analysts at Investec note, no details on actual policies were forthcoming. This is what will determine China's recovery, so until more clarity emerges, investors' optimism may fade as quickly as it appeared. The mainland property index is still down 13% this year and the Hong Kong-based index is down 25%. Maybe they are cheap enough to draw in buyers, but the problems run deep. That said, MSCI's Asia ex-Japan equity index on Tuesday ended a six-day losing streak and rallied 2%. The MSCI World index rose for the 10th session of the last 12, reaching its highest level since April last year, and the S&P 500 also climbed to a new 15-month high. Surprisingly strong U.S. consumer confidence, growing faith in an economic 'soft landing', and the Artificial Intelligence buzz around juicy earnings reports from Big Tech firms all contributed to the latest Wall Street rally. Strong results from Microsoft and Alphabet after the bell will only strengthen the upbeat tone in Asia on Wednesday too. All this comes ahead of the first of three major central bank policy decisions this week - the Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates 25 basis points on Wednesday, followed by a similar move from the European Central Bank on Thursday and the Bank of Japan holding the line on Friday.

Fed officials are gathering for their July monetary policy meeting, starting on Tuesday, where the central bank's rate-tightening cycle will be top of the agenda. Most market participants expect the Fed to deliver a 25 basis-point rate hike when the meeting concludes on Wednesday. U.S. Treasury yields advanced, with benchmark 10-year notes rising to 3.890% while rate-sensitive two-year notes were up at 4.8806%. Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are among U.S. technology giants whose quarterly earnings on Tuesday give investors a glimpse of the health of the U.S. economy. The performance of these megacap tech companies underlies the nearly 19% year-to-date rally in the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX). After the bell on Tuesday, Alphabet said second-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street expectations. Microsoft on Tuesday surpassed Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit as its cloud business benefited from product upgrades featuring new artificial intelligence (AI) technology. ""There's a bit of catch-your-breath mentality before what could really be a big market moving event with the big Fed meeting tomorrow,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. ""At the same time, the Fed is important but corporate earnings matter. Overall, it's been fairly positive and people expect earnings to come in better than expected,"" Detrick said. The MSCI All-World index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks equities in more than 50 countries, rose 0.47%. Europe's STOXX 600 (.STOXX) gained 0.48%, led in part by shares in mining companies, which rallied after China's leaders pledged to bolster their sputtering economy. On Wall Street, the three main indexes closed higher, led by gains in shares of technology, materials, and communication services companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.08% to 35,438.07, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.28% to 4,567.46 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 0.61% to 14,144.56. ""A 25 basis-point hike is pretty much baked in but clearly what matters more is whether (in Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference) it's going to be a dovish or hawkish hike,"" Detrick added. Oil prices rose to three-month highs as signs of tighter supplies and pledges by Chinese authorities lifted sentiment. Brent futures settled up 1% at $83.64 a barrel after hitting $83.87 earlier, the highest level since April 19. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 1% to settle at $79.63. The U.S. dollar weakened, losing earlier session gains, ahead of the Fed meeting as well as rate decisions from other key central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The dollar index fell 0.128%, with the euro down 0.1% to $1.1051. Gold prices strengthened as the dollar fell.

Signs of an extremely resilient U.S. economy helped the currency recover from a recent 15-month low, as well as persistent weakness in Europe. U.S. consumer confidence increased to a two-year high in July amid a persistently tight labor market and receding inflation, bolstering the economy's prospects in the near term. Still, the economy is not out of the woods, with the survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday offering mixed signals. Consumers remain fearful of a recession over the next year following hefty interest-rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve. ""There was a lot of anticipation that we were going to get consolidation leading up to the Fed, and for the most part, risk appetite has been hanging in there. What we're probably going to see is the forex market is really going to have to have a wait and see approach,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in New York. ""We might have an initial move post Fed, but we then have to really pay close attention to not just ECB but also the BOJ. So, I think FX volatility should still remain elevated, and that's why we're not seeing a lot of positioning on the day like today."" The dollar index fell 0.108% to 101.280, after hitting a two-week peak earlier of 101.65. The euro fell for a fifth successive session, and was down 0.13% to $1.1048 as evidence of a slowdown in Europe builds after a recent survey showed demand for loans in the euro zone hitting a record low in the second quarter, and separate data showed deterioration of business confidence in Germany this month. This follows disappointing Purchasing Manager Indexes on Monday that came in below expectations for the euro zone as a whole. Markets have plenty more to watch as the Fed concludes a rate-setting meeting on Wednesday, followed by the European Central Bank (ECB) a day later and the Bank of Japan on Friday, as well as earnings from heavyweight companies. Both Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are due on Tuesday. ""In the last week or so, there have been wobbles on market views about both the outcomes for the Fed and the ECB in September and investors will be looking for some clarity from policymakers this week – though it cannot be assumed that this will be provided,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank London.

At a time when the wider rally has made some stocks, especially in the tech space, too expensive, the return of meme stocks is offering retail investors a more affordable option to participate in 2023's market rebound and pocket big returns. Roundhill's Meme index (.MEME) hit a one-year high last week and was last up 60% for 2023 so far, dwarfing gains of more than 18% recorded by the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX). The NYSE FANG+ index (.NYFANG), housing megacap technology and growth stocks like Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), has climbed 77% so far this year. ""Some of the retail animal spirits are coming back, but it's a little bit more complex than the first time around,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital. ""There's widespread panic-buying and catch-up trade from those who risk going into the year-end flat while the S&P is up 18%."" Retail investors poured in $1.27 billion per day on average into U.S. equities in July, closing in on the all-time record of $1.5 billion a day in March, Vanda Research said. ""What we have seen historically is that when short squeezes are happening in some of these zombie-like companies that are burning cash or in really beaten down names, that's usually more indicative of a sign of the end of the bull market as opposed to beginning,"" said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst at Triple D Trading. The meme index consists of 25 equal-weighted U.S.-listed stocks with a combination of elevated social media activity and high short interest. It is rebalanced every two weeks. Recent examples of rallies include a 33% jump in shares of cinema operator AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) on Monday and a 40% rise in shares of troubled used-car retailer Carvana (CVNA.N) last Wednesday. Net retail investor flows into Carvana hit their highest in over a year last week, before sliding a little on profit-taking, according to data by Vanda Research, while flows into AMC touched 11-month highs on Monday. Shares of Carvana, which is also the top holding of Roundhill's meme index with a nearly 5% weighting, are up about 850% so far this year but are still far from their all-time highs hit during the meme stock mania of 2021. About 28.1% of AMC's publicly available shares are under short position, according to data by analytics firm Ortex, while 55.2% of Carvana's free float shares are shorted.

The mood on world markets generally was lifted by a bounce-back in ailing Chinese stocks - a delayed reaction to Monday's somewhat vague statement from the country's ruling Politburo on supporting the ""tortuous"" economic recovery there. The 4% snapback in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HSI) - still down almost 2% for the year - was driven by a 12% surge in the beaten-down property sector (.HSMPI) but only brought the overall benchmark back to where it was on July 14. The wider blue-chip CSI 300 Index (.CSI300) snapped a six-day losing streak to pop 3% and buying from state banks propped the yuan. In sweltering Europe, the tone was more subdued as a survey of big banks by the European Central Bank - also meeting this week - showed business demand for loans dropped in the second quarter to their lowest in the 20-year history of the poll as credit conditions tightened further. German business confidence sagged again this month too. Euro/dollar slipped further after the reports. All of which painted a confusing picture of the global demand pulse going into the Fed meeting, with Monday's news of ebbing U.S. business sentiment in July at least showing overall growth in activity - in contrast to the euro zone contraction. A jump in crude oil prices to three-month highs on Monday - due to a major U.S. refinery outage and background China stimulus hopes - was twinned with a 10 basis-point spike in two-year Treasury yields on a downbeat auction to add to the messy dashboard. Both oil and Treasury yields gave back some of those gains again today, however, with year-on-year crude price declines still tracking more than 21%. S&P500 and Nasdaq stock futures pushed higher, after fresh Wall St gains on Monday that saw Dow Jones bluechips (.DJI) clock an 11-day winning streak for the first time in more than six years. VIX (.VIX) volatility gauges subsided from two-week highs. There was little ostensible reaction to the formal rebalancing of the Nasdaq 100 (.NDX) index that pared weightings of several of the big caps to reduce ""over-concentration"". With the earnings season in full swing, investors now focus on readouts from mega caps Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) after the bell on Tuesday - with the bar high after this year's AI-infused stock surges and sky-high valuations. The approach of Wednesday's Fed decision may limit market moves until then. As it stands, futures are fully priced for another quarter-point rate hike to the 5.25-5.50% range - and still see this as likely the last in the cycle as markets indicate less than a 50% chance of another move later in the year. Easing expectations for 12 months time are gradually being reined in however.

Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Visa (V.N), recruiter Robert Half (RHI.N), General Electric (GE.N), 3M (MMM.N), Dow (DOW.N), chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN.O) and grain dealer Archer-Daniel Midlands (ADM.N) are among the heavyweights and highlights in the United States. Unilever (ULVR.L), LVMH and EssilorLuxottica (ESLX.PA) report in London and Paris. The corporate performance and outlook risk disappointing markets that are increasingly priced for a ""soft-landing"" slowdown in both growth and inflation. In the Asia session investors cheered pledges of support in the readout from an earlier-than-expected Politburo meeting in China -- though not too loudly. Property stocks in Hong Kong surged, only they had spent much of the past week or two descending deeper into the discount cellar so gains came from a low base. The Hang Seng (.HSI) rose about 3% and the Shanghai Composite (.SSEC) roughly 2%, but neither is roaring out of recent ranges. The yuan jumped, but it had help from China's state banks, which sources said were buying onshore and offshore early in the Asian day. Morgan Stanley analysts made much of the absence in the readout of a familiar line that ""property is for living not for speculation"" and the addition of a pledge to ""optimise"" policy. ""Investors should recall that the early stage of COVID easing was labelled as 'optimised' policy, which led to a complete change of the policy later,"" they wrote. Traders are buying it today, but may not do so tomorrow while a cash crunch looms over giant names like Country Garden and Dalian Wanda. The Eurozone bank lending survey is also out on Tuesday and can give a view on the health of borrowing ahead of Fed and European Central Bank meetings, which are both expected to deliver rate hikes. The yen was steady in Asia as investors weigh whether the Bank of Japan will tweak policy on Friday.

22,2023-07-25,0.9774,"2023-07-25Cadence lifts full-year forecast, shares dip on short-term outlook|July 24 (Reuters) - Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS.O) on Monday raised its full-year revenue forecast to slightly above Wall Street estimates, as a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) innovation fueled demand for custom semiconductor design. Demand for the software used to design chips has risen even amid a cyclical downturn for the industry as chipmakers and tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) rush to create their own semiconductors needed for AI processing. But Cadence's current-quarter forecast had a midpoint slightly below analyst estimates, sending shares down 4.4% at $230.60 in after-hours trading. ""Similar to last quarter, shares have performed well into the results and backlog is down modestly (down $100M). I think it's just a little sell the news action after market,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy told Reuters in an email. Cadence also sells hardware systems that run its chip design software, and Chief Executive Anirudh Devgan told Reuters in an interview the current-quarter forecast is lower than it might otherwise be because ""some hardware deliveries are at the border in September and October."" He said the company is ""being extra conservative"" by forecasting those orders for the fourth quarter. Cadence forecast full-year revenue between $4.05 billion and $4.09 billion, largely above analysts' average estimate of $4.06 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The company's earlier estimate was for $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share for 2023 between $5.05 and $5.11, beating expectations of $5.03 per share. Revenue was $976.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, above estimates of $974.9 million. But Cadence gave a revenue forecast range of $990 million to $1.01 billion for the current quarter, with the midpoint of $1.0 billion falling slightly below Refinitiv estimates of $1.01 billion. Like its rival Synopsys Inc (SNPS.O), Cadence is hoping to benefit from AI in at least two ways: first, by providing tools to design chips for AI; and second, by adding AI into its own software to help in the complex process of designing chips. ""This is going to take some time, which is part of the natural process of trying and deploying"" new technologies, Devgan told analysts on a conference call.

""What you're seeing now is people broadening the breadth of the market,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ""People are starting to maybe take some profits (in tech) and invest in other parts of the markets that they might see a little bit better bargain."" Investors are awaiting Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) earnings this week, which will show whether their stocks justify sky-high valuations. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC) has rallied 34.3% this year, outperforming its peers as rate-sensitive megacap growth companies rose on optimism about artificial intelligence and an end to the Fed's tightening cycle. The Nasdaq (.NDX) lagged other indexes as investors looked to non-tech stocks for bargains, lifting sectors from energy to banks. Helping the Dow (.DJI) notch its longest winning streak since February 2017, Chevron (CVX.N) gained almost 2% as the oil giant posted upbeat preliminary quarterly earnings over the weekend. As of Friday, second-quarter earnings are expected to decline by 7.9%, Refinitiv data showed. Investors ignored a survey showing July U.S. business activity had slowed to a five-month low, dragged down by decelerating service-sector growth. ""You've got an increasing belief that soft landing and an increasingly dovish Fed may occur,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer with the BMO Family Office, adding some sideline cash is coming back to stocks. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its policy-making meeting on Wednesday. A majority of economists polled by Reuters expect this to be the last hike of the current tightening cycle, after data this month showed signs of disinflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 183.55 points, or 0.52%, to 35,411.24, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 18.3 points, or 0.40%, to 4,554.64 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 26.06 points, or 0.19%, to 14,058.87. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.43 billion shares, compared with the 10.30 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by a gain in energy stocks (.SPNY). Toymaker Mattel (MAT.O) rose 1.8% as the ""Barbie"" movie set a record as the biggest domestic debut of 2023. AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) jumped 32.9% after a judge blocked the theater chain's stock conversion plan that risked diluting investors' holdings in the company. AMC's preferred shares closed flat. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies like Alibaba and JD.com rose 4.5% and 3.5% respectively as its top leaders announced economic policy adjustments to expand domestic demand. Exchange operator Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) trimmed the weight of a handful of companies that make up close to half of the Nasdaq 100 to address ""over-concentration"" in the benchmark. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.61-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

24,2023-07-24,0.9907,"2023-07-24Global shares, U.S. yields rise as investors eye rates, earnings|NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Global equity markets and Treasury yields rose on Monday as investors braced for interest rate decisions from key central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, as well as corporate earnings that may shed light on the state of the economy. An overwhelming majority of traders expect the Fed to raise rates by 25 basis points at its policy meeting this week, according to CME Group data, helping to revive concerns of a looming recession following resilient U.S. economic growth. The European Central Bank is also expected to maintain a hawkish stance when it meets this week, while the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its super-loose monetary policy intact after its meeting. The yields on 10-year notes were at 3.874%, rebounding from an early session decline, while the rate-sensitive two-year yields were up at 4.8917%. Yet, markets are also anticipating buoyant results from major U.S. companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), whose performance has mostly underpinned the nearly 19% year-to-date gain in the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX). ""The most over-used phrase in this industry is 'cautiously optimistic' but that is where we are,"" said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund. ""We still think that in general the economy is going to be growing but there will be continued rolling recessions of segments of the economy, which is really healthy because it tends to lead to significant long-term bull markets,"" Plumb said. The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up 0.21%, while European stocks (.STOXX) added just 0.06%. On Wall Street, the three main indexes closed higher, led by gains in financial, consumer discretionary, technology and energy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.52% to 35,411.24, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.40% to 4,554.64 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 0.19% to 14,058.87. ""The consensus is for the Fed to raise by 25 basis points and then some more indication that they could be at the end. We don't have much insight that it would be different but if it is, then it would dramatically increase the volatility of markets,"" Plumb added. The U.S. dollar edged up against major currencies after economic data continued to show the resilience of the American economy compared to its peers. The purchasing managers' survey showed on Monday that U.S. business activity slowed to a five-month low in July, dragged down by decelerating service sector growth, but the data was better than similar surveys out of Europe. The dollar index rose 0.297%, with the euro down 0.56% to $1.1061. Oil prices rose by more than 2% to a near three-month high buoyed by tightening supply, rising U.S. gasoline demand, hopes for Chinese stimulus measures and technical buying. Brent futures rose 2.1% to settle at $82.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 2.1%, to settle at $78.74. Prices of safe-haven gold were choppy as the dollar advanced.

Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) dipped 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively, while Alphabet (GOOGL.O) added nearly 1% and Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) were near unchanged. Before trading begins on Monday, exchange operator Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) will trim the weight of a handful of companies that make up close to half of the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq describes the Nasdaq 100 as a ""modified market capitalization-weighted index,"" with company weights depending on their stock market value, while also applying rules to limit the influence of the largest stocks in the index. The Nasdaq 100 includes 100 of the largest companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange, and changes to the index will force investment funds that track it to adjust their portfolios and sell shares of companies that have their weight in the index reduced. ""We estimate that declining weights will drive passive net selling worth more than a day's average trading volume in GOOGL and more than one-third of a day's volume in MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA,"" Goldman Sachs wrote in a client note on Monday. J.P.Morgan index strategist estimated passive outflows of about $30 billion from mega-cap stocks. Broadcom (AVGO.O), which will likely see its weight increase in the Nasdaq 100 following the rebalance, rose 1.6%. The chipmaker currently makes up 2.4% of the index, according to Refinitiv data. Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon and Tesla have been among the biggest winners in the U.S. stock market's recovery this year, increasing their combined influence in the Nasdaq 100. That has helped the Nasdaq 100 surge 42% in 2023, compared to a 25% increase in the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index (.NDXE). The Nasdaq 100 was near flat on Friday. Nasdaq announced its plan to rebalance the index on July 7. A special rebalance may be triggered if the aggregate weight of companies individually accounting for more than 4.5% of the index tops 48%, according to Nasdaq.

26,2023-07-24,0.9952,"2023-07-24Big Tech looks to turn the corner on cloud as AI focus stays strong|July 24 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giants could signal an end to the nearly year-long slowdown in their cloud businesses as signs of economic resilience encourage clients to boost technology spending, while a pickup in digital ads will also aid profits. Microsoft, Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon.com and Meta Platforms — companies that are together valued at over $6 trillion — are set to report earnings this week and the next, in what will be a test for their hefty valuations and the broader market rally they have driven thanks to optimism over artificial intelligence. ""We're really only looking for metrics that point to ramping user traction for AI-based offerings, with the idea being that they will generate more meaningful revenue in the medium-term,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane said. The four companies have this year aggressively integrated AI into their products on hopes that it would drive the industry's next growth cycle, but those efforts will take time to pay off. For Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) — the three biggest players in the cloud market — the April-June quarter is expected to mark another period of dismal growth in the business that has long been a cash cow. Both Amazon and Alphabet will likely report their lowest-ever growth for the cloud computing business at 9.8% and 24.4%, respectively, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv. Meanwhile Microsoft Intelligent Cloud, home to Azure, is expected to grow at 13.7%, the slowest rate since 2017. However, several analysts believe the trend is about to change. ""While the macro continues to be soft, it is not getting materially worse and companies are figuring out how to operate in this,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said. The current quarter will also have easier year-ago comparisons as the cloud slowdown started in the September quarter of 2022, Jaluria added. A recent survey by RBC Capital of more than 150 enterprise technology buyers showed that over four-fifth of them were funding projects related to generative AI and they broadly expect IT spending to increase this year over 2022. For Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O), revenue is expected to grow at its fastest pace in six quarters thanks to a pickup in the digital advertising market as consumer spending stays strong. ""If the digital ad space is like riding a roller coaster, we are just about done with the boring/tough part, slowly climbing to the top chain link by chain link,"" Bernstein analysts said. The digital ad market recovery will also aid Alphabet, whose Google Search has so far avoided any meaningful market share loss to Microsoft's AI-powered Bing. Alphabet is expected to report 4.5% revenue growth in the April-June period, its best in three quarters. ""Google Search has seemingly shifted from market share risk to monetization risk, but with search share seemingly healthy, Google may have less urgency to integrate LLM (large-language model) results into commercial queries,"" analysts at BofA Global Research said. Microsoft and Alphabet will report quarterly results on July 25, Meta on July 26 and Amazon on Aug. 3. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9952"
27,2023-07-24,0.9762,"2023-07-24Morning Bid: Euro biz ebbs, China property and rate peaks?|A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Another worrying drop in European business activity and a fresh property sector jolt in China encourages speculation the world's two most powerful central banks may end interest rate tightening campaigns this week with their final hikes of the cycle. In a week packed with market-moving events - G3 central bank decisions, mega-cap tech earnings, a Chinese Politburo meeting and second-quarter U.S. output numbers - the prospect of peak U.S. and euro zone interest rates will loom large. Futures markets assume the Federal Reserve's expected quarter-point hike to 5.25-5.50% on Wednesday will be its last of a 16-month squeeze, with less than a 50% chance of a further move later in the year priced. And money markets also see the European Central Bank's likely quarter point rate rise to 3.75% the following day as the last, again placing less than a 50-50 chance of another hike after that. The Bank of Japan is expected to hold the line on its super-easy money policy for now. Arguments for calling a halt to the credit tightening were strengthened on Monday as early July business surveys for the euro area came in well below forecasts, showing a deepening contraction in overall activity this month. The euro dropped more than half a percent against the dollar as euro government debt yields fell back, with an indecisive weekend election result in Spain adding pressure. With the ongoing slide in manufacturing still the biggest drag and due in large part to China's spluttering post-Covid recovery, further turbulence in China's property markets will only increase the anxiety. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index (.HSI), down more than 5% for the year so far, dropped another 2% on Monday and its index of mainland property developers (.HSMPI) plunged 6.4% - its second biggest daily drop of 2023. Debt repayment concerns at two of the country's biggest developers - Country Garden and Dalian Wanda - deepened a crisis of confidence in the sector. China's ruling Politburo met on Monday to shape its strategy for the year ahead and early local media readouts said it expects the economic recovery to be 'tortuous' requiring macro adjustments of a precise and forceful manner. Markets have worried that any stimulus to the flagging economy to date have largely been piecemeal moves. Hopes the BOJ stands pat on monetary policy helped Japan's Nikkei (.N225) outperform and it jumped more than 1%. For Wall St, the looming Fed decision dominates this week - with a check on U.S. July business surveys topping the data on Monday's calendar in another huge corporate earnings week. Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) report on Tuesday and Meta (META.O) is due out Wednesday, with massive 70%-plus share price gains so far this year for the mega cap tech vanguard index (.NYFANG) raising the bar and investors keen to hold AI-related excitement up to the light. Wall St's main stock indices ended marginally higher on Friday, with the Dow Jones bluechip index (.DJI) eking out its 10th consecutive daily gain for the first time in more than six years. Both S&P500 and Nasdaq futures pushed higher again on Monday, although the VIX volatility gauge (.VIX) popped to its highest in almost two weeks. U.S. Treasury yields fell back, but the dollar (.DXY) climbed against the euro, yuan and sterling - also hit by disappointing UK business readings for July. Events to watch for on Monday: * S&P Global July flash business surveys from the United States and around the world, Chicago Fed June business survey * U.S. corporate earnings: Whirlpool, Domino's Pizza, Brown & Brown, Alexandria Real Estate, NXP, Packaging Corp of America, F5, Cadence Design Systems * World Trade Organization general council meets in Geneva * U.S. Treasury auctions 2-year notes, 3- and 6-month bills Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.9762"
28,2023-07-24,0.993,"2023-07-24Take Five: School's (not) out for summer|LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - The peak holiday season is gearing up, but school's not quite out for summer in financial markets. With the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan meeting, the first snapshot of July business activity, earnings and a Spanish election on the calendar, there's lots going on. Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Naomi Rovnick, Alun John and Dhara Ranasinghe in London. And just like that, the next Federal Reserve meeting is right around the corner. U.S. inflation is cooling but markets expect one more rate hike on July 26. The more interesting question is whether Chair Jerome Powell will signal the Fed is more confident inflation can cool further while growth stays resilient, meaning the most aggressive rate hiking cycle in decades is nearing an end. Signs that the Fed is unlikely to raise rates much further would, in theory, keep the wind in the sails of a buoyant Wall Street, while the dollar's tumble will likely continue. Also in focus are earnings from some of the massive tech and growth stocks that have led markets higher this year. Among them are Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), which report on July 25. Before they go on their summer break, ECB policymakers have a well-flagged rate hike to deliver. That will come on Thursday, with the key deposit rate tipped to rise a quarter point to 3.75%. ECB chief Christine Lagarde will no doubt be pressed for clarity on what happens in September, and economists are divided over whether there will be another rate increase or pause. Note, hawk Klaas Knot says any move beyond July is ""by no means a certainty"". Underlying inflation, a key focus for the ECB, remains high, but economic growth is weakening. The previously resilient services sector barely grew in June. The July PMI snapshot of business activity, out globally in coming days, should provide some further insights, as should the ECB's latest bank lending survey. Rate-setters' summer reading list just got longer. The Bank of Japan wants to promote communication with markets, but something may have been lost in translation. Comments from top rate-setters have tied investors in knots before a keenly anticipated two-day policy meeting starting on Thursday. Governor Kazuo Ueda's message of ""steady as she goes"" on stimulus, including yield curve control (YCC), was seen, by some, to have been undone by recent remarks by deputy Shinichi Uchida. Uchida says he ""strongly acknowledges"" YCC's negative impact, which hawks took as a hint of an imminent raising of the 0.5% ceiling for 10-year bond yields. Ueda then again backed continued easing in its current form and data on Friday showed inflation may have peaked. The benchmark yield has swung from 0.4% to a four-month high of 0.485% over the past two weeks, with the market dividing itself sharply into two camps. That creates plenty of opportunity for another jolting BOJ surprise. 4/ STOP: IT'S EARNINGS SEASON European quarterly earnings are starting to trickle in. The season will be a crucial one, with the STOXX 600 share index (.STOXX) up about 8% year to date. The rally has sputtered in July ahead of what Barclays describes as a ""make it or break it"" quarterly reporting season. Second-quarter earnings are expected to decrease 9.2% from a year earlier, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, with aggregate earnings likely to be weighed down by poor performance from energy companies. Stocks rallied earlier this year as investors, who were mostly bearish about Europe, switched their positions as global growth continued to defy expectations. That is a macroeconomic story rather than an earnings narrative, which makes European equities vulnerable to companies missing profit targets. A better than expected outcome, on the other hand, could fuel another bull run. No clear winner emerged in a nailbiting finish to Spain's election on Sunday, meaning political uncertainty could weigh on markets in the days ahead. The two leading parties - the conservative People's Party and the ruling Socialist Workers' Party - will seek to negotiate coalition deals in pursuit of a governing majority. But analysts warned the process could end in a hung parliament and another election. Also in focus is whether pressure on the main parties to cut taxes or increase spending worsens Spain's finances. High debt above 100% of GDP, a slowing economy and tighter EU fiscal rules coming into force in 2024 are concentrating minds. Stock-pickers are also keeping an eye on the energy sector, where the two main parties have different priorities, and financials, with the outlook for Spain's temporary banking levy in doubt.

29,2023-07-24,0.9229,"2023-07-24Morning Bid: Markets bide time as policymakers plot next moves|SYDNEY, July 24 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Stella Qiu It's a week that every investor has squarely on their radar: Three of the world's biggest central banks will deliver their latest policy moves and China's Politburo - its top policymaking body - is set to unveil support measures as the economy sputters. Meanwhile, markets seem to be biding their time. On Monday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was off a slight 0.3%, European stock futures were marginally lower and U.S. futures were flat. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HSI) was a bit of an outlier on the downside with a drop of 1.5%, dragged lower by Chinese property developers (.HSMPI) which tumbled more than 5%. With a quarter-point hike from both the Federal Reserve (on Wednesday) and the European Central Bank (on Thursday) looking set in stone, the focus will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde say about the rate outlook. If markets are right, this should be the last hike from the Fed and second-to-last from the ECB, as investors look ahead to the end of the great synchronised global tightening campaign - and rate cuts that may soon follow. , The U.S. earnings season will also move into higher gear this week with Meta Platforms (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) among the big names reporting. Their results will have to be good enough to justify the S&P 500's earning multiple of 20 times and its gains of 19% year-to-date. In Asia, contrary to what some investors were expecting, the Bank of Japan，which meets on Friday，is leaning towards keeping its yield control policy unchanged so that policymakers can scrutinise more data to ensure wages and inflation keep rising, sources told Reuters. That report sent the yen to a two-week low of 141.95 per dollar on Friday but the currency regained some composure in Asia as the new week began, steadying at 141.36 per dollar. Manufacturing activity in Japan extended declines in July while growth in the service sector slowed, surveys showed on Monday, a sign that global demand remains week and is weighing on Japanese businesses. For those looking for major stimulus from China's politburo meeting, which is expected to come on Friday, they risk disappointment again after months of anticipation. Piecemeal support measures from the government's various agencies in recent days to prop up the property sector and consumption have failed to impress. Beijing likes to do things on its own time and, after all, growth is still tracking in line with the government's economic target for the year of about 5%, although some big global banks have only recently cut their forecasts to come in line with that.

30,2023-07-23,0.9022,"2023-07-23Morning Bid: G3 central banks and China Politburo bonanza|July 24 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. The week ahead could be pivotal to the financial market landscape for the rest of the year, as the G3 central banks deliver their latest policy decisions and China's Politburo of the ruling Communist Party meets to discuss the economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan decisions and press conferences all come over the Wednesday-Friday 48-hour period, and China's Politburo is expected to begin its meet on Friday. If that wasn't enough, purchasing managers index figures will give the first indications on how economies performed in July. The U.S. earnings season moves up a gear with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet among the big names reporting. Dovish signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell would probably boost risk appetite and lift global stocks markets. The dollar and U.S. bond yields would likely come under downward pressure too - often bullish triggers for Asian and emerging markets. Investors in Asia have to wait until Friday for the big two set pieces of the week. More than three quarters of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to keep policy unchanged, including its yield control scheme. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his resolve to maintain massive monetary stimulus, despite inflation persistently outpacing the bank's 2% target. In a symbolic development last week, Japan's annual rate of headline consumer inflation rose above comparable U.S. inflation for the first time since 2015. But the BOJ's deflation battle scars run deep, so investor hopes of and end to super-loose policy are being pushed back further. It's a different story in China - the economy and markets are badly underperforming, growth forecasts are being slashed, and the big danger is deflation, not inflation. The central bank has been reluctant to ease policy because the already weak yuan could come under even greater selling pressure, so investors are pinning their hopes on a fiscal boost from Beijing. And it will have to be a significant boost. Measures announced on Friday to help boost sales of cars and electronics failed to impress investors, and foreigners are steering clear of China's financial assets even though they are relatively cheap. But the economic, financial, political and social challenges Beijing faces are such that Chinese stocks can get even cheaper before foreign investors start buying again en masse. Monday's economic data calendar and potential market-movers in Asia will be the Japanese and Australian PMIs, and the latest inflation figures from Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysian inflation is expected to fall to 2.4% in June - the lowest since April last year - from 2.8% in May. Singapore's inflation is seen falling to 4.55% - the lowest since February last year - from 5.10%. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Monday: - Japan PMIs (July) - Australia PMIs (July) - Singapore inflation (June) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

31,2023-07-21,0.997,"2023-07-21OpenAI, Google, others pledge to watermark AI content for safety, White House says|WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) have made voluntary commitments to the White House to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to help make the technology safer, President Joe Biden announced on Friday. ""These commitments are a promising step but we have a lot more work to do together,"" Biden said. At a White House event, Biden addressed growing concerns about the potential for artificial intelligence to be used for disruptive purposes, saying ""we must be clear-eyed and vigilant about the threats from emerging technologies"" to U.S. democracy. The companies - which also include Anthropic, Inflection, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and OpenAI partner Microsoft (MSFT.O) - pledged to thoroughly test systems before releasing them and share information about how to reduce risks and invest in cybersecurity. The move is seen as a win for the Biden administration's effort to regulate the technology, which has experienced a boom in investment and consumer popularity. ""We welcome the president’s leadership in bringing the tech industry together to hammer out concrete steps that will help make AI safer, more secure, and more beneficial for the public,"" Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday. Since generative AI, which uses data to create new content like ChatGPT's human-sounding prose, became wildly popular this year, lawmakers around the world began considering how to mitigate the dangers of the emerging technology to national security and the economy. The U.S. lags the EU in tackling artificial intelligence regulation. In June, EU lawmakers agreed to a set of draft rules where systems like ChatGPT would have to disclose AI-generated content, help distinguish so-called deep-fake images from real ones and ensure safeguards against illegal content. U.S. Senate Majority Chuck Schumer in June called for ""comprehensive legislation"" to advance and ensure safeguards on artificial intelligence. Congress is considering a bill that would require political ads to disclose whether AI was used to create imagery or other content. Biden, who hosted executives from the seven companies at the White House on Friday, said he is also working on developing an executive order and bipartisan legislation on AI technology. ""We'll see more technology change in the next 10 years, or even in the next few years, than we've seen in the last 50 years. That has been an astounding revelation to me, quite frankly,"" Biden said. As part of the effort, the seven companies committed to developing a system to ""watermark"" all forms of content, from text, images, audios, to videos generated by AI so that users will know when the technology has been used. This watermark, embedded in the content in a technical manner, presumably will make it easier for users to spot deep-fake images or audios that may, for example, show violence that has not occurred, create a better scam or distort a photo of a politician to put the person in an unflattering light. It is unclear how the watermark will be evident in the sharing of the information. The companies also pledged to focus on protecting users' privacy as AI develops and on ensuring that the technology is free of bias and not used to discriminate against vulnerable groups. Other commitments include developing AI solutions to scientific problems like medical research and mitigating climate change. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

32,2023-07-21,0.8316,"2023-07-21Ad group Interpublic cuts growth forecast as tech clients dial back spending|July 21 (Reuters) - Interpublic (IPG.N) lowered annual growth expectations on Friday and posted a fall in quarterly revenue as clients in the technology sector slashed marketing budgets, sending the advertising group's shares down more than 12%. Rival Omnicom also posted weak earnings for the quarter, underscoring the pressure on ad agencies as economic uncertainty prompts businesses to tighten their budgets. Interpublic, which has clients that include Alphabet-owned Google and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), said it now expects full-year organic revenue growth of between 1% and 2%, compared with its prior projection of 2% to 4%. ""Tech continued to weigh significantly on growth,"" said CEO Philippe Krakowsky, adding the results were ""inconsistent with our expectations"". The owner of Mediabrands, R/GA and MullenLowe posted a 2.5% fall in revenue to $2.67 billion for the April-June quarter. The drop was due to broad-based weakness in its major markets, with net revenue falling 2.5% in the U.S and 4.3% in Europe. Net profit was $265.5 million, or 69 cents per share, compared with $229.6 million, or 58 cents a share, from a year earlier, on the back of lower interest expense. Interpublic had previously said it was investing in artificial intelligence and hired senior executives to lead its AI efforts. R/GA has also brought in generative AI into its creative processes with clients such as Verizon, Opendoor and Nike. Analysts, however, worry the rise of in-house AI tools provided by third-party vendors or digital platforms could prompt clients to abandon services from advertising agencies. Shares of Omnicom were down more than 5%. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.8316"
33,2023-07-21,0.9712,"2023-07-21OpenAI's head of trust and safety steps down|STOCKHOLM, July 21 (Reuters) - OpenAI's head of trust and safety Dave Willner is leaving the company, he said in a LinkedIn post on Friday, citing the pressures of the job on his family life and saying he would be available for advisory work. Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati will directly manage the team on an interim basis, and Willner will continue to advise through the end of the year, OpenAI said in a statement. Trust and safety departments have taken on a high-profile role in technology companies such as OpenAI, Twitter , Alphabet and Meta (META.O) as they seek to limit the spread of hate speech, misinformation and other harmful content on their platforms. At the same time, concerns about the negative impact of AI have risen. Describing Willner's work as ""foundational in operationalizing our commitment to the safe and responsible use of our technology,"" the company said it is seeking a ""technically-skilled lead"" as his replacement. Willner took over his role at OpenAI in February 2022 after working at Airbnb (ABNB.O) and Facebook. He attributed his decision to quit to growing demands from his job affecting his family life. ""Anyone with young children and a super intense job can relate to that tension, I think, and these past few months have really crystallised for me that I was going to have to prioritise one or the other,"" he said in the post. ""I've moved teaching the kids to swim and ride their bikes to the top of my OKRs (objectives and key results) this summer."" Microsoft-backed OpenAI, whose AI chatbot ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer application in history earlier this year, has said it depends on its trust and safety team to build ""the processes and capabilities to prevent misuse and abuse of AI technologies"".
