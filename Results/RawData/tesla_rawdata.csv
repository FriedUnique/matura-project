Panasonic, which supplies almost all of its EV batteries to Tesla (TSLA.O), is seeking to increase global market as Chinese and South Korean competitors grow their presence, the Nikkei said. It did not provide any source for its report. The Nikkei said there was a possibility that Subaru may opt to use 4680 batteries, the newest cells championed by Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, for which Panasonic's energy unit is looking to increase production. A Panasonic spokesperson said it was examining various growth strategies for its automotive business but there was no new information it could share. A spokesperson for Subaru, which relies heavily on the North American market for its sales, declined to comment. Panasonic will release first quarter earnings results on Monday, while Subaru will do so on Wednesday. Panasonic's energy unit and Mazda Motor 7261.T announced in June they also would start talks to set up a battery supply partnership for EVs. Subaru said in May it was aiming for global sales of 200,000 battery-powered vehicles a year by around 2026 as it seeks to tap into the growing EV market.

2,2023-07-28,0.8442,"2023-07-28Global automakers scramble to reset China strategies as sales slow|SHANGHAI, July 28 (Reuters) - For foreign automakers in China, it is time to double down on a turnaround or cut losses after ceding their leadership of the world's biggest auto market to local, upstart brands. Announcements from some of the world's largest automakers in recent days show they are taking a divergent path: some German brands and General Motors (GM.N) are betting on new electric vehicles, while Toyota (7203.T) and others have shifted to cost-cutting mode. For the first time, Chinese brands are market leaders, taking a 53% share in the first half of 2023, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed. Global automakers, who for years have dominated the market along with their Chinese state-run partners, have been slow to pivot to the fast-growing market for EVs with competitive offerings. That has been costly. Tesla (TSLA.O), which has its largest factory in China, was the only foreign brand to take share in the first half, topping BMW (BMWG.DE) in popularity, according to CAAM data. With added pressure on China margins from a brutal price war this year, some automakers are scaling back with production cuts and layoffs, including Toyota and Mitsubishi (7211.T). But brands that drew a third of their sales from China before this year's wipeout have no choice but to double down, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. That includes Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and GM. Volkswagen, which has been outsold by BYD (002594.SZ) since late 2022, announced two agreements on Wednesday aimed at strengthening its position in China: a partnership with China's Xpeng Inc (9868.HK) to build two new models from 2026 featuring Xpeng's software, and plans to jointly develop Audi models and a new platform with its Chinese partner SAIC (600104.SS). ""This major collaboration between Volkswagen and Xpeng is a milestone for our electrification strategy 'in China for China',"" said Ralf Brandstatter, a VW board member on his social media account. GM, which saw a 9% decline in its Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac sales in China in the first half, has been counting on EVs developed on its Ultium platform to turn things around. It has sold more than 12,000 Ultium-based EVs since the first model, the Cadillac Lyriq, started sales a year ago. Last month, GM cut the price of the luxury Lyriq by 14% in China. ""We've got to have the right EVs at the right price with the right technology,"" GM CEO Mary Barra told investors on a conference call on Tuesday, referring to the company's China strategy. ""VW and GM, who have historically been leaders in the market, both believe they can salvage their positioning and protect the share they currently have,"" said Tu Le, an analyst at China-based research firm Sino Auto Insights. ""It points to how important China is for their global ambitions and, to a lesser degree, the confidence that they can ultimately design, engineer and manufacture products that can compete with Tesla and China EV Inc."" The price war has cut into margins for Chinese EV makers too, and many remain unprofitable. Their deeper pockets give established foreign automakers who are determined to fight for share in China, the ability to play a long game. ""We'll allow our enemies to fight first, and we will come back with bags of money and technologies to take them,"" Yang Honghai, chief operating officer of Kia China, said at an industry forum in June. ""We are not giving up on the market but only choosing to come back at a more appropriate time,"" he said. Kia (000270.KS) is to enter China's EV market with its first EV, the EV6 crossover, via imports in August. German luxury brands BMW, Mercedes Benz (MBGn.DE) and Volkswagen's Audi managed to hold share roughly flat in China in the first half after offering dealer discounts that topped 25% in some cases, according to sales data and analysts who track pricing. BMW also announced an increased investment in product development in China with a new research and development hub in Shanghai to develop EVs to be sold globally. ""The German brands benefit from significant global scale,"" said He Lei, CEO of Chinese EV trading platform xChuxing. ""Meanwhile, they are continuously chasing Chinese competitors with China-developed products. How can they not be competitive?"" Some are pulling back. Mitsubishi Motors has closed a plant run with a joint-venture partner that makes the Outlander SUV while the two companies try to negotiate a restructuring after sharp sales declines. Toyota, which fell to No. 3 in China in the first half, has slowed production at a joint-venture plant that makes its bZ4X EV and laid off 1,000 contract workers. Nissan (7201.T), which will bring four new models to China, including an EV, said this week it would consider exporting cars from China to other regions to take advantage of China's cost advantages, a strategy Tesla, BMW, Ford (F.N) and Renault (RENA.PA) have also pursued. ""China is not just a place to sell cars. It's also a place to drive economies of scale, which lower your cost and improve your ability to compete internationally,"" said Bill Russo of Automobility, an industry consultancy in Shanghai.

3,2023-07-28,0.9643,"2023-07-28Brazil's Vale to sell 13% stake in base-metals unit for $3.4 billion|SAO PAULO, July 27 (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale (VALE3.SA) said on Thursday it reached two separate agreements to sell a 13% stake in its base metals business for $3.4 billion, aiming to boost its copper and nickel output. The sale is part of Vale's strategy to unlock more value from its nickel and copper assets, given expectations for soaring demand for the metals from the electric vehicle market. A joint venture formed by Saudi Arabian Mining Co (Ma'aden) (1211.SE) and the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will acquire 10% of Vale's base metal unit, while U.S. investment firm Engine No. 1 will acquire 3%. The cash deal expected to close by the first quarter of 2024 values the company's base metals unit at an enterprise value of $26 billion, it said. Vale's market capitalization in the Brazilian stock exchange was $67.4 billion, based on Thursday's closing price. ""With our high-quality portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to meet the growing demand for green metals essential for the global energy transition,"" Vale's CEO Eduardo Bartolomeo said in a statement. It follows a plunge in the miner's profits in the second-quarter, posted separately on Thursday, which fell 78.2% from the previous year, dragged down by lower iron ore prices. Vale's core business is iron ore production and distribution, but its base metals unit also produces copper and nickel at mines in Brazil, Canada and Indonesia. With its new partners, Vale aims to invest between $25 billion to $30 billion in strategic mineral projects over the next decade, it said. This would enable a ""significant potential increase in our copper production"" to about 900,000 metric tons per year, from 350,000 tons, it said. Nickel output would grow to more than 300,000 metric tons per year, from the current 175,000 tons. Vale has previously signed contracts to supply nickel to major automakers including Tesla (TSLA.O) and General Motors (GM.N).

4,2023-07-28,0.9963,"2023-07-28Dow Jones index set to end 13 day winning streak|July 27 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was on the verge of ending its longest winning streak in 36 years on Thursday, successive gains showing that Wall Street's tech-driven rally is broadening to include a wider chunk of the stock market. The Dow closed higher for 13 straight sessions through Wednesday, its longest series of positive closes since 1987, and was last down 0.5% on Thursday afternoon after gaining earlier in the session. While the S&P 500 (.SPX), which includes over 500 stocks, is many investment professionals' preferred stock market benchmark, the Dow's daily moves are widely quoted in news media, making it widely recognized by many Americans. Its recent rally comes as traders widely believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday was the last in its campaign to control inflation. Investors are also optimistic the U.S. economy will avoid a recession. The Dow's longest-ever winning streak was 14 sessions, set in 1897, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Even after its recent gains, the Dow has lagged Wall Street's other main indexes in 2023. It is up 7% year to date, compared to a 18% gain in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq's (.IXIC) 35% surge. ""The Dow has been the laggard of the big three, and now it seems to be playing catch up. I think that catch-up trade is bringing us to a healthier place,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. The Dow's 30 constituents do not include market heavyweights Tesla (TSLA.O), Meta Platforms (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) or Amazon (AMZN.O), major winners in a stock market rally this year fueled by optimism about artificial intelligence and an eventual end to the Fed's rate hikes. ""We are actually seeing the market broaden out, so it's not just about seven artificial intelligence anointed darlings,"" Hogan added. Dow components Salesforce (CRM.N), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have rallied between 40% and 70% this year, making them the Dow's top performers. But the Dow has also been held back by declines of 10% or more in Amgen (AMGN.O), Chevron (CVX.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA.O). Overall, nearly half of Dow constituents remain down in 2023, even after outperforming so far in July. While the Dow's recent winning streak is unusually long, its overall strength has not been exceptional. The index climbed 4.8% since July 7, compared to 3.1% increase in the Nasdaq and a 3.4% rise in the S&P 500. The Dow's last 13-day winning streak in January 1987 produced a gain of 11.1%.

5,2023-07-27,0.7096,"2023-07-27US Senate panel passes AM radio, ticket fee pricing bills|WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee approved legislation on Thursday to bar automakers from eliminating AM broadcast radio in new vehicles and require companies like Ticketmaster to put total ticket prices including fees in marketing materials. The committee acted on a number of bills before Congress heads out on its August recess, approving two bills aimed at tightening privacy protections for children online. The update of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which first became law in 2000, would raise the age of children protected by the measure from 12 and under to 16 and under. The AM radio bill and the ticket-pricing bill both had strong bipartisan support and both have companion measures in the House of Representatives. Fees on ticket prices have become an increasing issue. They can comprise 21% to 58% of ticket prices for some events, according to studies from the New York Attorney General's office and Government Accountability Office. Concert-goers have been annoyed with Ticketmaster for years, and the most recent catalyst for criticism came in November when frustrated Taylor Swift fans battled its website, often unsuccessfully, to buy tickets for the pop star's first tour in five years. The AM radio bill would direct the Transportation Department to issue regulations mandating AM radio in new vehicles without additional charge. Senators said this year that at least seven automakers have removed AM broadcast radio from their electric vehicles, including Tesla (TSLA.O) BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). Ford (F.N) reversed course in May under pressure from Congress. Lawmakers say losing AM radio undermines a federal system for delivering key public safety information to the public. The National Association of Broadcasters said the bill ""will ensure that the tens of millions of AM radio listeners across the country retain access to local news, diverse community programming and emergency information."" The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing major automakers, opposed the measure: ""This is simply a bill to prop up and give preference to a particular technology that’s now competing with other communications options and adapting to changing listenership.""

6,2023-07-27,0.9858,"2023-07-27Italian brake maker Brembo sees few signs of slowdown|July 27 (Reuters) - Premium brake maker Brembo (BRBI.MI) posted a 12.7% increase in its half-year core earnings, driven by an automotive sector which remains robust at the top end of the market, its chairman told Reuters on Thursday. The Italian company said its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) amounted to 344 million euros ($383.2 million) in the first six months of the year, supported by all business segments and markets in which it operates. Executive Chairman Matteo Tiraboschi said Brembo retained solid pricing power, thanks to the high quality and high technological content of its brakes. ""If I look at our business volumes for the coming months I hardly see any signs of a slowdown, at least in our segment of high-end applications,"" he said. ""The market remains healthy,"" he added. The chairman, however, said the Chinese market grew by less than forecast in the first half, while the second half of 2023 is expected to be in line with the same period of 2022, ""without big accelerations"". Brembo supplies top automakers including Ferrari (RACE.MI) and Tesla (TSLA.O), as well as several Formula One teams. The margin on the company's EBITDA came in at 17.6% in the first half, slightly up from 17.5% a year earlier. ""Our plants are operating smoothly, our supply chain is in good shape,"" Tiraboschi said. Brembo confirmed its forecast for revenue growth of about 10% this year, with percentage margins in line with the previous year. Brembo's shareholders this week also approved a plan announced in June to move the company's legal headquarters to the Netherlands, a move aimed at increasing M&A opportunities.

7,2023-07-27,0.9838,"2023-07-27VW cuts sales outlook as EV competition heats up|BERLIN, July 27 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) on Thursday cut its full year sales target and pledged to improve its cash position in the second half by hiking prices and cutting costs as the German carmaker seeks to fend off tough competition in China, its top market. The reduced sales target of 9-9.5 million vehicles, from 9.5 million previously, was down to a dip in first-half sales in China, Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said. Antlitz said the so-called ""performance programmes"" in the works to make the group's brands more efficient would have to begin yielding results this year, adding it had no time to lose in the face of rising competition. Its next Capital Markets Day in April 2024 will focus on its strategy in China, where Volkswagen still hopes to be the number one international carmaker, though its electric vehicle (EV) sales for now lag local EV makers and U.S. rival Tesla (TSLA.O). ""Competition is intensifying and customers are cautious,"" Antlitz said on a press call following half-year results, referring to the global autos market. ""We need to achieve the first results of these programmes in the second half of 2023 to make us more resilient."" The company's shares were down 3.3% at 1115 GMT. Despite lowering its deliveries target, Volkswagen kept its 2023 financial guidance unchanged. But that contrasts with recent increases at several rivals, which Royal Bank of Canada analysts said suggested a likely downshift in the second half. ""I see the 9 to 9.5 million deliveries scenario as the best case .... communication should be more conservative. Investors feel the worst is yet to come,"" Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper said. Volkswagen is in the midst of a strategy shift aimed at proving to investors it can protect market share in the transition to electrification. Still, its mass-market business in particular is struggling to boost margins, lagging competitors like Renault (RENA.PA) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) despite the German group's pledge to put profits over volume. Higher prices and revenues from internal combustion engine cars should help cushion its finances in the second half, Antlitz said. [1/2]Volkswagen's factory is seen in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo state, Brazil June 28, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Benassatto/File Photo Supplies of key components such as semiconductors had improved but transport and logistics delays had weighed on the first half, Volkswagen said. ""We are now moving from a bottleneck in chips to a bottleneck in transport,"" said Antlitz, adding steps had been taken to eliminate the hold-ups and reduce waiting time. ""The focus for the second half is now on strengthening net cash flow,"" he said. Cash flow, which plunged over 71% in the second quarter to 226 million euros, would improve over time as inventories go down, he said, sticking to the lower end of the firm's full-year cash flow target of 6-8 billion euros ($6.7-8.9 billion). The core Volkswagen Passenger Cars, VW Commercial Vehicles, Seat, Skoda and Cupra brands achieved an operating margin of 5.5% in the first half. Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati made a 10% operating margin. Volkswagen also said it had sold its Russian operations for 125 million euros. In May, the company said it had sold its shares in Volkswagen Group Rus to Art-Finance, which is supported by autodealer group Avilon.

Chipmakers have been reporting sluggish demand, with rival Texas Instruments (TXN.O) saying earlier this week that some clients were cancelling orders, while Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) said last week that even booming AI chips had not offset broader market weakness. ""You know that smartphones this year overall will decrease,"" STM's Chief Executive Jean-Marc Chery said in a call with analysts. ""The inventory correction in personal electronics is going on, will still continue in Q3 as well."" The company expects third-quarter net revenue of $4.38 billion, up 1.2% from a year earlier, which JPMorgan analysts said was slightly above consensus estimates. However, the brokerage noted end-quarter inventories were 20.7% above the three-year seasonal average. STM's shares were up around 4% as of 0944 GMT, after they fell 3.5% initially. Automakers' push to make electric vehicles and develop driving assistance technology have eased challenges in the semiconductor sector also grappling with U.S.-China trade spats. STM, whose clients include Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O), credited automotive demand for the 12.7% rise in its second-quarter net revenue to $4.33 billion, slightly above analysts' consensus based on Refinitiv Eikon data. ""We will build more capacity for our European and global customers in advanced technologies and their transition to digitalisation and decarbonisation,"" Chery said. STM and Global Foundries (GFS.O) are investing some 7.5 billion euros ($8.35 billion), including French state aid, to build a major chip factory in Crolles, southeastern France. The group also sharpened its full-year outlook, expecting revenue of $17.4 billion, give or take $150 million, against its April guidance range of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion.

9,2023-07-27,0.9203,"2023-07-27Western car makers look to slash EV costs to fight Chinese 'invasion'|PARIS, July 27 (Reuters) - Western automakers are fretting about an ""invasion"" of cheap Chinese electric cars in Europe, prompting France's Renault (RENA.PA) to say on Thursday it was aiming to slash production costs for its electric models by 40%. Finance chief Thierry Pieton said the best way to fend off price competition was for Renault to cut its own development and manufacturing costs. While the targetted 40% reduction is from 2027 onwards, Chief Executive Luca de Meo said the group would start seeing significantly lower production costs from the second half of this year, thanks to a fall in raw material costs. ""It's clear we are in competition and that time is of the essence, but that's the business we are in,"" he said. Delivering affordable electric vehicles (EVs) has become a priority for car makers worldwide as the shift to cleaner driving has come with high prices, due largely to battery costs. Chinese manufacturers such as BYD (002594.SZ) and SAIC have invested heavily in the shift, using lower labour costs and local battery suppliers to get a head start over many rivals. In 2022, Chinese car makers had a 9% share of Europe's EV market, nearly double the previous year's figure, according to forecasts by consultancy Inovev. And the pace is picking up. Like other EV makers, Renault also faces increased pressure from U.S. rival Tesla (TSLA.O), which has cut prices several times this year even as that has eaten into its margins. As an example, Tesla this year cut U.S. prices of its Model Y long-range version by a quarter to $50,490. That is having an impact. According to researchers Jato Dynamics, Tesla and SAIC's MG were the biggest market share winners in Europe during the first half of this year. Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Peugeot-to-Fiat carmaker Stellantis (STLAM.MI), warned on Wednesday the competition with Chinese manufacturers would be ""extremely brutal"". ""Their cost competitiveness is 25% against us. We have to fight,"" he said, describing the Chinese push as an ""invasion"". ""We need to use our own costs to make sure that we keep on making profit with affordable prices for our middle classes."" Tavares said Western car makers needed to use ""the same weapons"" as their Chinese rivals, sourcing parts in lower cost countries and striking partnerships with battery suppliers that offer the best combination of energy, cost and weight. ""It means that we need to come up with a sourcing proposal that allows us to sell those cars like the Citroën C3 at 25,000 euros or less in a profitable manner,"" he said. Once-dominant Western automakers are also striving to regain ground in China itself, the world's largest car market, after losing share to local manufacturers. Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) said on Thursday it was sticking to its strategy and would not engage in a price war to ""buy"" market share in China. Asked about Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) move to build new models with Chinese partners and potentially co-create local platforms, Mercedes CEO Ola Kaellenius said the premium carmaker was working with partners in China to adapt its technological offering to local taste. ""We are not handing the task of creating the Mercedes of the future to another OEM (manufacturer) - that task stays with us,"" Kaellenius added.

The company, which supplies General Motors Co (GM.N), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and others, warned it faces weaker EV demand in Europe and China than previously expected. ""We expect the market environment in the second half of this year will not be easy,"" said LGES Chief Financial Officer Lee Chang-sil, adding that EV sales in Europe, especially, had been sluggish due to economic headwinds such as high inflation. The U.S. is the only market where demand forecasts have not been cut, the company said. LGES reported an operating profit of 461 billion won ($363 million) for the April-June period, up from 196 billion won a year earlier, but that was far below the company's estimate of 612 billion won and an average analyst forecast of 641 billion won compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. The miss was driven by a one-off cost of 151 billion won which LGES said reflected higher costs of materials to meet GM's Bolt EV recall, which involved replacing battery packs and modules due to fire risks with earlier models. ""There is no change in the scope of the recall. And, from the current point of view, the chances of a further rise in recall costs appear to be quite low,"" LGES Vice President Jang Seungkwon said during an earnings conference call.

12,2023-07-26,0.978,"2023-07-26In challenge to Tesla, automakers launch US EV charging network|July 26 (Reuters) - Seven major automakers on Wednesday said they were forming a new company to provide electric vehicle charging in the U.S., in a challenge to Tesla (TSLA.O) and a bid to take advantage of Biden administration subsidies. The group includes General Motors (GM.N), Stellantis (STLAM.MI), Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and its Kia affiliate, Honda (7267.T), BMW (BMWG.DE) and Mercedes Benz (MBGn.DE) - brands representing about half of U.S. vehicle sales but a small share of the EV market dominated by Tesla. The unusual coalition of competitors - that according to some lawyers might raise antitrust concerns - said the new joint-venture aims to roll out 30,000 chargers in North America, starting along major highways and in cities. The automakers did not specify how much they would invest individually or collectively, but said they would be open to additional investment or participation from other companies, including outside the auto industry. A name for the venture was not announced. ""The investment will be far less through this partnership than building individual charging networks,"" said Akshay Singh, a partner at consultancy PwC Strategy&. ""They also get to control the customer experience and collect data."" There are more than 30,000 fast-charging machines around the nation. Each can cost anywhere from less than $100,000 to more than $200,000 for the most powerful versions. Industry executives familiar with the cost of chargers said establishing this venture could cost multiple billions of dollars. The White House lauded the deal. ""We think this is an important step forward,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. ""It's creating new union jobs for installation and maintenance. The Biden administration has set a target of hitting 500,000 chargers by 2030, an almost four-fold increase. Tesla, which accounted for more than 60% of U.S. EV sales last year, has the largest network of fast-chargers with almost 18,000 Superchargers. Tesla said earlier this year it would open part of that charging network to EVs from rivals in order to be eligible for a share of funding from $7.5 billion in federal subsidies. Tesla's lead in building out a network of chargers has given it sway in setting standards, something rivals have viewed with concern. GM, Mercedes and others have signed on to adopt Tesla-developing charging technology from 2025. GM previously said it could save $400 million from getting access to Tesla's network. On Wednesday, it said the new venture was part of its effort to reduce cost and ""won't change GM's existing commitments or collaborations."" The other automakers – Stellantis, Hyundai, Honda and BMW – have not committed to the Tesla technology known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS) and have product plans that rely on a rival known as the Combined Charging System (CCS). The new charging company will support both charging standards but will compete with Tesla's network. CEOs of the seven auto brands said a charging network built out like gas stations with restrooms, food service and retail operations would support a faster EV rollout. Automakers, however, lack the necessary electricians or experience working with retailers, said Andres Pinter, co-CEO at installation and maintenance company Bullet EV Charging Solutions. ""It won't be easy for the automakers to catch up,"" he said. ""But they do have boatloads of money to throw at the problem and should outsource that work."" The new venture would also compete against established charging companies, including Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Electrify America and EVGo (EVGO.O). Industry officials said the new venture might be structured similar to Ionity, which was founded in 2017 in Europe and counts VW, Daimler , BMW, Ford <F.N> and Hyundai as members. Asked whether the new venture would raise antitrust concerns with, a spokesman for the group cited the joint statement where the companies said it was subject to regulatory approvals. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Andre Barlow, an antitrust attorney with Doyle Barlow and Mazard, said the Justice Department would likely review the deal despite White House support. A common concern with joint ventures is that a legal collaboration could potentially lead to illegal coordination, like price fixing or dividing up markets, he said. ""There are antitrust risks. You have seven car manufacturers that are going to be getting together in terms of this joint venture,"" he said. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|0.978"

The Volkswagen brand will partner with Xpeng Inc (9868.HK) to produce two models targeting the middle-class segment which will carry the VW logo but feature Xpeng know-how on software and autonomous driving, a win for the EV startup that is less than a decade old. The new models, to be rolled out from 2026, will plug a gap in Volkswagen's product lineup in China, where the market for so-called ""new energy vehicles"" has grown faster than expected and Volkswagen lags local competitors and Tesla (TSLA.O). The carmaker is coming under heavy investor pressure over its China presence, both in terms of boosting EV sales and ensuring its slate is clean on labour rights issues in the Xinjiang region where it co-owns a plant with SAIC. Volkswagen's China Chief Ralf Brandstaetter recently criticised the market in China for electric, plug-in and fuel cell vehicles as becoming too crowded and lacking funding for long-term development. The carmaker said it will invest around $700 million in Xpeng and purchase a 4.99% stake in the company. Brandstaetter has long said that Volkswagen's China strategy rests on collaborating with local actors, with Xpeng the latest in a string of partnerships with Chinese firms that have included battery-maker Gotion and technology firm Horizon Robotics. For Xpeng, one of the smaller players in China's EV sector, the partnership offers leverage of Volkswagen's supply chain and sourcing capabilities as well as a boost to the reputation of its platform and technology, Daniel Roeska of Bernstein Research said in a note. Volkswagen also announced plans further cooperation between its subsidiary Audi and Chinese heavyweight SAIC (600104.SS), but did not specify which models the two companies would develop together or when a joint platform could emerge. The models would be in a segment Audi has yet to broach in China, the company said, as the premium brand plays catch-up in the Chinese electric vehicle market, where its performance has so far been weak.

The world's third largest automaker by sales said on Wednesday its January-June adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 11% to 14.1 billion euros ($15.6 billion), topping the 12.1 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. New CFO Natalie Knight, who took the job this month, said pricing power was still the main driver for the results of the group whose brands include Fiat, Peugeot, Alfa Romeo, Ram and Jeep.

The world's No.3 automaker by sales together with affiliate Kia Corp (000270.KS) forecast 2023 revenue would grow 14-15%, up from its January guidance of 10.5-11.5%, while its operating profit margin was upwardly revised to a range of 8-9% from 6.5-7.5%. ""The company expects to strengthen sales momentum through production improvements as chip and component supplies stabilise worldwide ... and enhance profitability despite global uncertainties such as interest rate fluctuations,"" Hyundai said in a statement. Its upbeat outlook comes amid growing concerns about cooling vehicle demand due to high interest rates and economic slowdown, with some of its rivals indicating price cuts to drive volume growth. Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk signalled last week that it would cut prices again on EVs in ""turbulent times"" to boost sales. Hyundai expanded operating margin to 10% in the second quarter from 9.5% in the first quarter. But its annual margin guidance of 8-9% indicates profitability will come under pressure in the second half, as supply chain bottlenecks ease further, allowing production to rise just when demand is expected to start cooling off. Yet some analysts are upbeat that constrained vehicle production triggered by a global shortage of chips that began during the COVID-19 pandemic would continue, buffeting the industry from overall economic slowdown that has dampened demand for most consumer goods. ""The current supply-demand dynamics where we see excessive demand would likely continue into 2025,"" said Kim Jinwoo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.

In the United States, Hyundai's biggest market, sales of green energy cars that include EVs and plug-in hybrids more than doubled to 46,000 units. Sales climbed thanks to increased incentives as Hyundai's EVs are not eligible for federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as they do not meet requirements. Zayong Koo, Hyundai's head of investor relations, told analysts on an earnings call that the size of EV incentives it spent in the U.S. market amounted to around $4,000-$5,000 per vehicle. The IRA requires 50% of the value of battery components to be produced or assembled in North America to qualify for a $3,750 credit and 40% of the value of critical minerals sourced from the United States or a free trade partner for a separate $3,750 credit. Overall vehicle sales in the U.S. grew 14% to 225,000 units, led by sedans, while in South Korea, its second-biggest market, sales rose 13% to 206,000 units.

17,2023-07-26,0.994,"2023-07-26Focus: In Mexico, private cash races to plug nearshoring energy crunch|MEXICO CITY, July 26 (Reuters) - For Mexican industrial park owners like Sergio Bermudez, business is booming amid a wave of U.S businesses setting up over the border. So-called nearshoring has pulled over $9 billion into Mexico since last October by manufacturers like Unilever (ULVR.L)
 , Barbie maker Mattel (MAT.O)
 , and Tesla (TSLA.O)
 , lured by its proximity to the giant U.S market, cheap labor, and geopolitical stability. Yet Bermudez and many of his 400-strong cohort have a serious cost issue on their hands: energy. Industrial parks are under pressure to spend millions of dollars to build federal power transmission lines and substations amid government underinvestment, growing energy demand, and aging infrastructure which is at capacity. While these parks have long contributed to state infrastructure, the lines and specifications now required are getting much longer and costlier in Mexico's manufacturing north, according to nearly a dozen sources. ""Federal funds can't keep up with the growth we're seeing… so the developers or companies have to absorb the cost,"" said Eduardo Martinez, an official for the state of Nuevo Leon, pointing to austerity and the unpredicted nearshoring boom. Sergio Arguelles, president of the Mexican Association of Private Industrial Parks (AMPIP), said parks' investment in state energy assets today is unprecedented. The group is yet to calculate exact amounts, but said it is ""very significant."" The lure of new clients for parks is strong, but it is still a bitter pill: with regulation restricting private ownership, park owners essentially donate the infrastructure to the state. ""It's the biggest challenge...We are thinking about how are we going to reach an agreement with the government to manage this for the good of the country,"" said Aaron Gallo, the real estate director at American Industries, whose multiple Mexican industrial parks cater to foreign clients like Danish toymaker Lego. American Industries is currently building a $12 million 12-kilometer (7.5-mile) line. Gallo said such investments mean they have as much as tripled energy costs for clients in recent years, complicated by lengthy permit processes. ""It's very bureaucratic, it does slow us down,"" said Gallo. ""But there’s no other option."" The issue underscores the holes in President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's attempt to concentrate power in the state energy utility company, CFE, which critics say is unfit to support Mexico's major growth opportunity. Though private sector assistance may help bolster Mexico's energy security in the short term, much more is needed accommodate the wave of new demand, said David Gantz, a fellow on U.S -Mexico trade at the Baker Institute. ""Mexico would be very well positioned to take advantage of nearshoring if it didn't have such an energy problem,"" he said. CFE did not respond to a request for comment. Mexico's approach to its groaning electricity grid is in contrast to its fast-growing peers, which tend to either incentivize private energy contractors or have state utility companies with deep pockets. Last year, CFE investment slid to 35.3 billion pesos ($2 billion), or 0.15% of GDP, a fraction of manufacturing rival China's planned investment in the grid of 0.9% of GDP, per Reuters analysis. Meanwhile, CFE built just under 150 km of transmission lines last year, more than 10 times less per 100,000 square km than in Brazil, where Electrobras said it added 8,679 km to the network. ""We needed a lot more,"" said AMPIP's Arguelles, noting the bulk of CFE's budget has gone to power generation rather than distribution and transmission infrastructure. Lopez Obrador has pressed hard to tighten state control of the energy sector, arguing that past governments rigged the market in the favor of private companies. Yet with billions dedicated to the heavily indebted state-oil company Pemex, industry observers say Mexico lacks the funds to support upgrades to the electricity network. ""The CFE had a very different vision and budget before,"" said Bermudez, whose family has been in the ""maquiladora"" or remote manufacturing business for decades. ""It used to be much easier."" Indeed, 91% of parks report issues related to energy supply, according to a recent AMPIP survey, including line congestion and being forced to turn away new clients. Meanwhile, Ramses Pech, CEO of energy consultancy firm Group Caraiva estimated 80% of infrastructure built in industrial areas is now privately funded. Still, there is some hope for the new wave of 47 planned industrial parks. The energy ministry said it plans to build around 3,000 km of transmission lines next year, as well as new substations, particularly in the north. Some argue that it is only right that the private sector pay its own way, especially given Mexico's relatively low corporation tax, and parks' healthy return on investment. Hans Joachim Kohlsdorf, an electricity wholesale executive in Mexico, argues that park owners often do not think strategically when setting up remote manufacturing hubs, and understands why the government is reticent to pay. ""There needs to be better planning,"" he said. ""We're in a Catch 22: (the parks) want everything free, and the other party doesn't want to pay."" Zonia Torres, a commercial director of an industrial park in the state of Guanajuato, which has paid for federal infrastructure, agrees. ""The CFE doesn't want to bet on future (energy) demand,"" she said, adding that Mexico is still ""an emerging market"" with limited resources. Yet critics say Mexico's push for state control over energy distribution while also neglecting it is self-sabotage. ""The network provider should be capable of building the infrastructure...The public policy does not take into account the reality, and the level of (foreign) demand."" said Alfredo Nolasco, founding partner of nearshoring consultancy Spyral.

The blizzard of market-moving news has done little to rein in the relentless climb of Wall St stocks so far this week, with the S&P500 (.SPX) hitting new highs for the year and the Dow Jones bluechips index (.DJI) clocking a 12th straight daily gain on Tuesday for the first time in six years. Unlucky for some perhaps, but a 13th today would make it the longest winning streak for the Dow since 1987. But this year's supercharged tech sector (.NDX), (.NYFANG) has been more hesitant in returning to the year's highs as its leading lights dish out earnings updates, with a high bar to impress given the scale of AI-infused share price already in 2023. Tesla and Netflix stumbled last week despite headline profit beats and Microsoft's (MSFT.O) ostensible forecast-beating earnings were the latest to underwhelm overnight, as disappointing projections for its cloud business sent its stock down 4% out of hours. Snap plunged 20% before the bell as its guidance fell short too. It not impossible to wow the gallery though. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) climbed 7% after hours as its results beat was accompanied by a surprising rebound in advertising and warmer words on its cloud operations. Meta Platforms (META.O) is up next after Wednesday's closing bell and its share rose 2%. Amazon (AMZN.O) lost 2% on reports the Federal Trade Commission is finalizing an antitrust lawsuit against the firm. The net impact on overall index futures has been marginal so far on Wednesday - a tick down in Nasdaq and Dow futures and a modest nudge up in S&P500. The wider market is held in check awaiting the Federal Reserve's latest quarter-point interest rate rise to 22-year highs of 5.25-5.50%, possibly its last in the cycle if futures are correct. U.S. two-year Treasury yields retreated into the decision and the dollar (.DXY) dialed back too. In the background, the regional bank sector was enlivened by more merger activity. Shares in PacWest (PACW.O) rose nearly 38% in premarket trading after news that smaller rival Banc of California (BANC.N), which rose 14%, had agreed to buy the lender for $1.1 billion. Wells Fargo (WFC.N), meantime, climbed 2.8% after the bank's board authorized a new $30 billion share buyback program. The Fed decision comes in the wake of another set of forecast-beating U.S. consumer confidence readings for July. Economists assume the central bank will retain a hawkish tone but keep its options on another hike open as it will have almost two months of data to assess before meeting again on September 20. Elsewhere, the European earnings season was in full swing too, with banks dominating the diary and the European Central Bank meeting tomorrow. Deutsche Bank < DBKGn.DE> stock fell 1% after the lender reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit as an investment banking slump offset higher interest income.

Shares were down 4.4% at $37.58 in mid-day trading. The automaker said it plans to invest less in new products and cut operating costs by an additional $1 billion through the end of next year, and lifted its full-year profit guidance. Chief Executive Mary Barra, in a call with analysts, said GM has reversed plans to kill its least expensive EV, the aging Chevrolet Bolt, at the end of this year. Instead, the company now expects to introduce an updated Bolt with a newer Ultium battery pack, but did not disclose details about cost, timing or plant location. ""A new Bolt should cost the same or less to produce than the outgoing model"" if it shifts to a dedicated EV platform and next-generation batteries, said Sam Fiorani, head of global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. Barra said battery production at the Ultium joint venture plant in Lordstown, Ohio, has been hampered because ""our automation equipment supplier is struggling with delivery issues."" The situation should be resolved by year-end, Barra said. GM in the meantime is building battery modules by hand on manual assembly lines, she said. GM said adjusted pre-tax profit and margins in its key North American market fell from the first quarter, despite a jump in revenue and per-vehicle transaction prices. Second-quarter results included a $792 million charge related to new agreements with EV supplier partners LG Electronics and LG Energy Solution. On a year-to-year basis, GM said net income for the second quarter rose by nearly 52% to $2.6 billion, as revenue grew 25% from the same period in 2022 when production was hobbled by semiconductor shortages. GM said it now expects full-year net income of $9.3 billion to $10.7 billion, up from a previous forecast of $8.4 billion to $9.9 billion. On a per-share basis, GM is forecasting net income of $7.15 to $8.15 for the year, up from a range of $6.35 to $7.35. The new outlook does not factor in the potential costs of a strike by the United Auto Workers union should it fail to reach a new contract with GM by the Sept. 14 deadline. The UAW focused on GM's robust revenues and profits, mostly earned from union-made trucks, and a statement that called on GM to offer more in contract negotiations now under way. ""Auto workers and our communities have yet to be made whole for the sacrifices we’ve made since the Great Recession,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said. GM's more bullish outlook comes after six months of stronger demand and richer pricing than expected earlier this year, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during a media conference call. But the decision to cut new product investment and operating costs comes as the automaker's profit margins are under pressure. GM's pre-tax profit margin for the first six months of the year fell to 8.3% of revenue, down from 8.9% a year ago. GM now plans to spend $11 billion to $12 billion on capital investments this year, down from an earlier plan to spend $11 billion to $13 billion. ""There's a lot of focus on winning with simplicity,"" Jacobson said. Barra said GM can cut capital spending by simplifying its product line, reducing the number of different combinations of colors and features offered. GM's goal is to cut the number of feature and color trim combinations by half, Barra said. In contrast to Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk's strategy of cutting prices to accelerate demand, GM pushed average transaction prices in North America up by $1,600 to about $52,000 in the latest quarter, Jacobson said. ""We're focused on profitability. Our recent results demonstrate that we're not sacrificing margin for volume,"" he said. Barra, in a letter to shareholders, said the automaker is aiming to build ""roughly 100,000 EVs in the second half of this year and we’ll grow from there."" In the first half, GM built about 50,000 EVs, most of them the older Bolt model, which is priced from $27,495. GM's earnings statement reiterated a previous target of building 400,000 EVs from 2022 through the first half of 2024, and projected EV revenue of $50 billion in 2025, with pre-tax profit in the low to mid single digits. A Reuters analysis in May noted that a slow ramp-up of GM battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan could limit the automaker's annual EV production to less than 600,000 at mid-decade, even as GM aims to increase capacity to 1 million by 2025. In a note to investors, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said he remains ""cautious due to the near-term earnings drag from GM's EV transition and its ability to execute an aggressive production ramp, as well as ultimate demand for its EV models.""

20,2023-07-25,0.9713,"2023-07-25GM does a U-turn to save the Chevy Bolt|July 25 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) CEO Mary Barra has staked billions on a broad lineup of electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Silverado EV designed from the wheels-up to be electric, software-defined vehicles that can match or beat any Tesla. On Tuesday, Barra made a significant exception, reversing a decision to phase out the Chevrolet Bolt. The Bolt does not align with GM's long-term EV technology strategy, but it is the Detroit automaker's best-selling and most affordable EV in North America, by far. News of its scheduled demise at the end of this year prompted criticism of GM for turning its back on an affordable EV in favor of large, expensive models such as the $80,000 and up GMC Hummer EV. GM is now planning a second-generation Bolt that will come with a new, more efficient Ultium battery pack that should cost 40% less than the current Bolt's battery technology, Barra told analysts. ""Instead of doing an all-new vehicle, we're really leveraging what was already there,"" Barra said. The decision to save the Bolt without re-engineering it from top to bottom reflects a new emphasis on what Barra called ""winning with simplicity."" A revamped Bolt ""should cost the same or less to produce than the outgoing model,"" said Sam Fiorani, head of global forecasting at consultancy AutoForecast Solutions. The Bolt's cost has been key to its relative success with a price that starts at $27,495 before federal and state EV purchase subsidies. Barra and GM officials did not say how much the new Bolt would cost or where it would be built. Tesla's (TSLA.O) Model 3 and Model Y outsell the Bolt in the United States by roughly four to one. For GM, the Bolt has been the mainstay for its North American EV sales. In the first six months of this year, U.S. Bolt sales totaled 33,659 vehicles, outselling Ford's Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and other EVs from established automakers. Bolt sales rebounded this year after GM was forced to halt production of the car for nearly six months to fix problems linked to battery fires. GM on Tuesday said it was taking a nearly $800 million charge to account for costs of that recall. Within GM's EV portfolio, the Bolt has represented more than 90% of its EV sales so far this year, in part because production of GM's purpose-built, Ultium-architecture EVs has been hobbled by problems at GM's new battery plant in Ohio. ""If I were GM, I wouldn't change much,"" said manufacturing expert Sandy Munro, president of Munro & Associates, which has done detailed analyses of the Bolt, Teslas and other EVs. ""You don't need to change the body. Elon Musk doesn't do that."" Fiorani said one of GM's Mexican assembly plants could be a leading contender to produce the new Bolt, although ""with UAW contract negotiations just starting, GM could offer a next-generation Bolt to a Michigan-area plant"" including its Orion Township facility where the current model is produced.

21,2023-07-25,0.9881,"2023-07-25EV charger operator EVCS seeks to raise $125 million to expand network|NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Electric-vehicle charger operator EVCS is looking to raise $125 million, according to a document seen by Reuters, as it races to expand its network of fast chargers eightfold by 2025 and capitalize on the U.S. government's push to boost EV adoption. A $5 billion federal program to electrify U.S. highways and a recent slew of deals by market leader Tesla (TSLA.O) to open up its charging technology to rival automakers has unleashed a capital-intensive race among charger makers and operators to offer new products and expand their networks. California-based EVCS has hired French bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) to advise it in the search for potential investors, according to the document dated June 2023 seen by Reuters. EVCS and BNP Paribas declined to comment. EVCS, which operates its own network of fast chargers as well as stations for clients such as Hilton, plans to increase its network to 2,100 fast chargers by 2025 from 260 currently and focus on the U.S. states of California, Washington and Oregon, according to the document. A person familiar with the matter said a $125 million investment would represent a large minority stake in the business. Reuters was not immediately able to ascertain what valuation the company or its advisers had arrived at for the entire business. Countries are offering grants, tax credits and other incentives to makers of electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to keep them moving, attracting private investment that is key to achieving targets such as the Biden administration's aim for EVs to make up 50% of U.S. new-vehicle sales by 2030. The deals between Tesla and rivals also could make it easier for operators to cater to virtually all EVs. Valuations of charging companies, much like electric-vehicle makers, crashed from lofty heights as broader electrification failed to take off in the past couple of years. Oil major Shell (SHEL.L), for example, bought charging firm Volta in January for $169 million, only two years after that California company notched up a $2 billion valuation in its merger with a blank-check acquisition firm. Now charging companies are hoping the federal funding will help stoke interest among investors who are nursing large pools of capital earmarked for environmentally friendly investments.

22,2023-07-25,0.8807,"2023-07-25Elon Musk to appeal loss in SEC case to Supreme Court|NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Elon Musk plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider whether the Securities and Exchange Commission overstepped its authority in enforcing a consent decree that he has called a ""muzzle"" on his free speech. Musk would be appealing a decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit of Appeals in Manhattan to uphold the decree, which arose from his August 2018 tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take his electric car company Tesla (TSLA.O) private. A three-judge panel rejected Musk's claim that the SEC, which accused the billionaire of defrauding investors, exploited the decree to conduct harassing investigations into his use of Twitter, which he now owns and this week renamed X. In an order on Monday, the appeals court denied Musk's request that the panel or all 13 active judges revisit the case. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, confirmed on Tuesday that Musk plans an appeal to the Supreme Court. The consent decree was part of a settlement where Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million fines, Musk gave up his role as Tesla's chairman, and Musk agreed to let a Tesla lawyer approve some tweets in advance. In its May 15 decision, the appeals court panel said Musk could not revisit the screening of tweets because he had ""changed his mind."" But Musk's lawyers said the SEC had no right to impose an unconstitutional ""gag rule"" as a condition of settling. The decision ""posits that Mr. Musk either had to forego a settlement with the SEC or give up his right to challenge the constitutionality of the SEC's demands,"" the lawyers wrote last month. ""Supreme Court law holds otherwise."" Last week, the federal appeals court in New Orleans agreed to reconsider its March decision that Musk violated federal labor law by tweeting in May 2018 that Tesla employees would lose stock options if they joined a union. The Supreme Court typically hears oral arguments in about 70 of the approximately 5,000 cases it reviews each year. The case is SEC v Musk, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-1291.

Net profit for the three months ended June came in at 10.895 billion yuan ($1.53 billion), up 63.22% from a year earlier, according to a Reuters calculation based on CATL's company filing. This compared with a 558% surge in its net profit in the first quarter. China's battery makers including CATL are facing challenges of weakening demand and bigger cost reduction pressure from EV makers amid a price war and a slowdown in auto sales this year. The EV battery market grew at a much slower pace this year with a 36.8% increase in battery installation volume in the first half compared with the 176.4% growth in the same period in 2022, data from China Automotive and Battery Alliance showed. CATL, which counts Tesla (TSLA.O) as its biggest client, has been losing market share to BYD , a major automaker that powers all its EVs with its own batteries. Automakers such as Chongqing Changan Automobile and Guangzhou Automobile Group also sourced more batteries from smaller suppliers to reduce costs. CATL is shadowed by a capacity glut with its production facilities as the utilisation rate dropped to 60.5% in the first half from 81.25% in the same period a year ago. The Chinese company also faces headwinds in efforts to expand globally, including an investigation by U.S. lawmakers into its partnership with Ford Motor (F.N) in the United States. CATL, however, extended its lead in the global EV battery market as its share increased to 36.3% in the first five months compared with 34.6% a year ago, according to data from SNE Research. South Korea's LG Energy Solution (373220.KS), which followed CATL and BYD with a share of 13.9%, forecast a 213% operating profit jump in the second quarter.

Speaking at a nickel industry conference hosted by CNBC Indonesia, Coordinating Minister of Maritime Affairs and Natural Resources Luhut Pandjaitan said the incentives will be benchmarked against those offered by regional rivals Thailand and Vietnam, but did not provide details. Indonesia, the largest economy in Southeast Asia, has been trying to attract EV makers to invest in the country, enticing them with its rich nickel reserves - the world's biggest - which can be processed into EV batteries. However, some automakers like China's BYD have instead chosen to invest in Thailand, the region's automotive hub. ""Tomorrow we are going to finalise incentives that we are going to give to any EV investment in Indonesia,"" Luhut said, adding they were awaiting President Joko Widodo's approval. Luhut said he will meet BYD executives in China's city of Chengdu on Thursday, and a meeting is also scheduled on August 3 with Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk in California, United States. Indonesia has been wooing Tesla for years, hoping to host an Asian production hub for the American EV maker. Tesla has been in talks with Indian officials for an investment in an EV factory there.

The JV between Toyota and China's state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) (601238.SS) laid off the workers over the weekend and offered them compensation, three workers, who declined to be named for privacy, told Reuters earlier. The workers affected were hired by labour service companies and dispatched to work at the factory in the southern city of Guangzhou. Toyota's JV in China, Guangzhou Toyota Motor Co, said in a statement to Reuters that it had prematurely terminated contracts for about 1,000 workers with labour services companies in light of recent production levels. The company would provide economic compensation as required by law and earnestly explain the situation to those affected, it said in the statement. The GAC Toyota factory has an annual output capacity of 1 million vehicles and employs around 19,000 people, according to its website. It produces models including Camry, Levin and bZ4X. Toyota's move comes after peer Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) said earlier in July it would cut staff costs at its Chinese joint venture with GAC to try to revive its fortunes. Mitsubishi Motors Chief Executive Takao Kato told reporters during an earnings call on Monday that the company had not yet agreed with its local counterpart in China exactly how it would pursue the restructuring. The production of Mitsubishi's new Outlander model remained suspended, Kato added, describing the conditions faced by the company in China as ""severe"". Japanese brands suffered the steepest sales slumps among automakers in China in the first half of this year, with their market share shrinking to 14.9% from nearly 20% a year ago, according to China Association of Automobile Association. Meanwhile, sales of Chinese brands accounted for 53% of the total. Toyota has been counting on its electric vehicle (EV) models to revive sales in China, which fell 9% in the first six months. The company joined a price war started by Tesla in January and slashed the starting price for its bZ4X EV by 15% in February. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.|-0.9136"
26,2023-07-24,0.926,"2023-07-24Tesla to discuss factory plan for new $24,000 car with India commerce minister|NEW DELHI, July 24 (Reuters) - Tesla representatives are set to meet India’s commerce minister this month to discuss plans to build a factory to produce what the company has described as an all-new $24,000 car, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Tesla has expressed an interest in building a factory in India that would produce low-cost electric vehicles (EVs) for the local market and for export, the person said, adding that the company had indicated that it would be for the new vehicle. The discussions represent a sharp reversal for the company after efforts last year to reduce import taxes on EVs shipped to India were scuppered by calls from government officials to commit to making cars locally. The meeting with the commerce minister would be the highest level discussions between Tesla and the Indian government since June when Elon Musk met India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he intended to make a significant investment in the country. The 2 million rupee ($24,000) EV Tesla representatives were said to have described in discussions about a potential Indian plant would be 25% cheaper than its current lowest priced offering, the Model 3 sedan which sells for the equivalent of just over $32,200 in China. The $24,000 target price for the new Tesla vehicle was reported earlier this month by The Times of India newspaper. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Electric vehicles currently account for less than 2% of total vehicle sales in India, now the world’s third largest auto market. Reuters reported in May that Tesla executives visited India and held talks with officials on establishing a manufacturing base for cars and batteries in India. Discussions with Indian government officials in New Delhi are scheduled to resume this month, two people with knowledge of the talks, who asked not to be named because the discussions remain private, told Reuters. As part of that, Tesla representatives are set to meet Indian commerce minister Piyush Goyal, the first person said, and discussions are expected to centre around setting up an EV supply chain and discussing land allotment for a factory. The commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Tesla has aggressively discounted its existing models since the start of the year while Musk has repeatedly said its long-term success will hinge on bringing down the cost of EVs sharply. Tesla has said its next-generation vehicle platform will slash production costs by 50% and that multiple models - including an automated ""robotaxi"" - could be built from it, without detailing what those future models will be or their pricing. A Tesla plant under construction in Mexico will produce vehicles on that lower-cost, high-volume platform, which the company has said it said it will take to other factories as well. Tesla currently produces EVs in California and Texas. Outside North America, it has plants in Berlin and Shanghai. The Shanghai plant is Tesla's largest, accounting for almost 40% of the automaker's global capacity. Plans to add additional capacity there are pending regulatory approval.

27,2023-07-24,0.9792,"2023-07-24Law firm Fisher Phillips expands to Mexico amid labor law changes, nearshoring|(Reuters) - Atlanta-founded law firm Fisher Phillips will establish three offices in Mexico with a team of lawyers from Deloitte, it said on Monday, citing ""surging"" demand for labor and employment advice in the country amid updated trade deals and manufacturing shifts. The labor and employment-focused law firm, which has about 550 lawyers and nearly 40 U.S. offices, will open an anchor office in Mexico City. It will also launch satellite outposts in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city, and the central state of Queretaro, which the firm said are emerging manufacturing hubs. The new offices are Fisher Phillips's first locations outside of the United States. Germán de la Garza de Vecchi, who previously led Deloitte's Mexican legal practice, joined Fisher Phillips to lead the three new offices. His team of about 30 lawyers in Mexico also moved to the firm. A Deloitte representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""The evolving landscape of Mexico's labor and employment laws, modernization of trade agreements, and the growing trend of companies near-shoring production closer to North American markets have fueled an increased demand for cross-border legal services,"" John Polson, chairman and managing partner of Fisher Phillips, said in a statement. Nearshoring refers to the trend to move production closer to North American buyers and away from Asia, where supply-chain snarls during the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed the region's low-cost advantage. Technology supplier Bosch Group, for example, announced plans last September to construct a 4.3 billion peso ($215 million) plant in Queretaro that would create more than 900 jobs. Tesla plans to build a new assembly plant in northern Mexico, the country's president announced in February. Online fashion giant Shein is exploring plans to build a factory in Mexico, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in May. The nearshoring trend is further testing a trade deal known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which has been in effect since July 2020. The agreement has tougher labor rules than its predecessor and underpins new Mexican laws that empower workers to push for better wages and conditions. The labor law reforms and the companies opening in Mexico have created a lot of work for labor and employment lawyers in Mexico, said de la Garza de Vecchi, who advises large international companies. Fisher Phillips said de la Garza de Vecchi has spent years ""cultivating credibility"" with union leaders and has advised regulators on labor law reform. His team previously worked together at a Mexican law firm, which Deloitte absorbed about three years ago. Former Deloitte members joining Fisher Phillips include Octavio Novaro Holguín, Victor Manuel Ávila, Andrea Brizio Rivas, Hector Cuevas, Víctor Manuel López, Ilyana Barrera and Christian Morales. The team, which de la Garza de Vecchi said totals about 60-70 lawyers and professionals, will advise large international clients on matters including employment law disputes and labor negotiations.

Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) dipped 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively, while Alphabet (GOOGL.O) added nearly 1% and Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) were near unchanged. Before trading begins on Monday, exchange operator Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) will trim the weight of a handful of companies that make up close to half of the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq describes the Nasdaq 100 as a ""modified market capitalization-weighted index,"" with company weights depending on their stock market value, while also applying rules to limit the influence of the largest stocks in the index. The Nasdaq 100 includes 100 of the largest companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange, and changes to the index will force investment funds that track it to adjust their portfolios and sell shares of companies that have their weight in the index reduced. ""We estimate that declining weights will drive passive net selling worth more than a day's average trading volume in GOOGL and more than one-third of a day's volume in MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA,"" Goldman Sachs wrote in a client note on Monday. J.P.Morgan index strategist estimated passive outflows of about $30 billion from mega-cap stocks. Broadcom (AVGO.O), which will likely see its weight increase in the Nasdaq 100 following the rebalance, rose 1.6%. The chipmaker currently makes up 2.4% of the index, according to Refinitiv data. Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon and Tesla have been among the biggest winners in the U.S. stock market's recovery this year, increasing their combined influence in the Nasdaq 100. That has helped the Nasdaq 100 surge 42% in 2023, compared to a 25% increase in the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index (.NDXE). The Nasdaq 100 was near flat on Friday. Nasdaq announced its plan to rebalance the index on July 7. A special rebalance may be triggered if the aggregate weight of companies individually accounting for more than 4.5% of the index tops 48%, according to Nasdaq.

Chinese automakers and U.S. company Tesla (TSLA.O), known for their competitive pricing, continue to perform well with high volumes, Favre said. ""We are fortunate to work with everyone, which means we also work with those who export,"" Favre said.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted Tesla's request to revisit the case ""en banc,"" meaning that its 16 active judges will take part. A three-judge panel of the same court had in March upheld a National Labor Relations Board ruling that Musk's May 20, 2018 tweet was an unlawful threat that could discourage unionization at his electric car company, and must be deleted. Musk issued the tweet as the United Auto Workers sought to organize employees at Tesla's plant in Fremont, California. ""Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted,"" he wrote. ""But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?"" The appeals court panel found ""substantial evidence"" that the tweet was ""an implied threat to end stock options as retaliation for unionization."" In seeking reconsideration, Tesla cited free speech concerns, and said the NLRB ignored that no employees claimed that Musk was threatening them, that Musk did not intend to threaten anyone, and that Musk later clarified his tweet was not a threat. The NLRB did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. A decision is unlikely before 2024. Twelve of the appeals court's 16 active judges were appointed by Republican presidents. Musk's use of Twitter has caused him trouble before, including when he tweeted in August 2018 about having ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. Musk did not, and he and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines to settle a subsequent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit. Musk's $236.4 billion fortune makes him the world's second-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. He bought Twitter in October for $44 billion.
